             Abstract 
             
            Ovarian carcinomas are thought to arise in the ovarian surface 
            epithelium (OSE) 
 Although this tissue forms a simple epithelial 
            covering on the ovarian surface, OSE cells exhibit some mesenchymal 
            characteristics and contain little or no E-cadherin 
 However, 
            E-cadherin is present in metaplastic OSE cells that resemble the 
            more complex epithelia of the oviduct, endometrium and endocervix, 
            and in primary epithelial ovarian carcinomas 
 To determine whether 
            E-cadherin was a cause or consequence of OSE metaplasia, we 
            expressed this cell-adhesion molecule in simian virus 
            40-immortalized OSE cells 
 In these cells the exogenous E-cadherin, 
            all three catenins, and F-actin localized at sites of cellâ€“cell 
            contact, indicating the formation of functional adherens junctions 
            Unlike the parent OSE cell line, which had undergone a typical 
            mesenchymal transformation in culture, E-cadherin-expressing cells 
            contained cytokeratins and the tight-junction protein occludin 
 They 
            also formed cobblestone monolayers in two-dimensional culture and 
            simple epithelia in three-dimensional culture that produced CA125 
            and shed it into the culture medium 
 CA125 is a normal 
            epithelial-differentiation product of the oviduct, endometrium, and 
            endocervix, but not of normal OSE 
 It is also a tumor antigen that 
            is produced by ovarian neoplasms and by metaplastic OSE 
 Thus, 
            E-cadherin restored some normal characteristics of OSE, such as 
            keratin, and it also induced epithelial-differentiation markers 
            associated with weakly preneoplastic, metaplastic OSE and 
            OSE-derived primary carcinomas 
 The results suggest an unexpected 
            role for E-cadherin in ovarian neoplastic progression

             Introduction 
             
            Epithelial ovarian carcinomas are the most prevalent and lethal of 
            all gynecological malignancies 
 Histopathological observations and 
            experimental data strongly suggest that these tumors arise from the 
            ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) (1â€“3) 
 Despite their epithelial 
            morphology, OSE cells exhibit mesenchymal characteristics that 
            reflect their mesodermal origin 
 Specifically, normal OSE cells 
            rarely express the epithelial cell-adhesion molecule E-cadherin, 
            they deposit stromal extracellular matrix proteins, and they produce 
            matrix-degrading metalloproteases (4â€“7) 
 Such characteristics likely 
            contribute to the ability of OSE cells to rapidly undergo 
            mesenchymal transformation in monolayer culture (8) 
 Although a 
            definitive premalignant lesion for ovarian carcinoma has not been 
            identified, OSE cell metaplasia is considered to be weakly 
            preneoplastic, particularly in women who are at increased risk of 
            developing the disease because of hereditary factors (2, 9) 
            Interestingly, metaplastic OSE cells, which are invariably 
            epithelial, often express E-cadherin (5, 6)
            E-cadherin is a 120-kDa transmembrane, calcium-dependent 
            cell-adhesion molecule 
 Adhesion is initiated by the binding of 
            homologous E-cadherin extracellular domains on adjacent cells, and 
            it is stabilized by the association of the intracellular E-cadherin 
            domain with Î±, Î², and Î³ catenins that are physically linked to 
            F-actin to form functional adherens junctions (10, 11) 
 E-cadherin 
            is required for epithelial histogenesis, tissue stabilization, and 
            differentiated function (12) 
 Developmental down-regulation of 
            E-cadherin, which is initiated by morphogen-mediated signals that 
            cause a translocation of Î²-catenin to the nucleus, induces an 
            epithelial-to-mesenchymal conversion that is required for cell 
            migration and tissue rearrangements during embryogenesis (13) 
 In 
            solid tumors, abnormal regulation or mutation of E-cadherin and 
            Î²-catenin contributes to the â€œmesenchyme-likeâ€ phenotype of many 
            late-stage, invasive carcinomas (14â€“16) 
 Thus, E- cadherin acts as a 
            master regulator of the epithelial phenotype (17)
            Although E-cadherin often is scanty or absent in ovarian carcinoma 
            metastases, it is almost always present in primary ovarian 
            carcinomas (18â€“23) 
 At first glance it seems paradoxical that 
            E-cadherin expression is increased in metaplastic OSE and primary 
            ovarian tumors 
 However, both lesions often resemble the more 
            complex Mullerian duct-derived epithelia of the oviduct, 
            endometrium, or endocervix 
 The latter tissues and the OSE share a 
            common embryonic precursor, the urogenital coelomic epithelium 
            Therefore, the appearance of Mullerian duct characteristics in 
            metaplastic OSE and primary ovarian carcinomas likely reflects an 
            aberrant differentiation toward tissue types of closely related 
            embryologic origin 
 To determine whether ectopic E-cadherin 
            expression is a cause or consequence of this aberrant 
            differentiation, we expressed the cell-adhesion molecule in normal 
            immortalized OSE cells
            Normal immortalized OSE cells transfected with a mouse E-cadherin 
            cDNA lost their mesenchymal characteristics and became 
            epithelialized 
 E-cadherin, all three catenins, and F-actin were 
            localized at cellâ€“cell borders, indicating the formation of 
            functional adherens junctions 
 In addition, the transfectants formed 
            tight junctions and re-expressed epithelial cytokeratins found in 
            normal OSE in vivo 
 In two-dimensional culture the transfectants 
            formed cobblestone epithelial monolayers, and in three-dimensional 
            sponge culture they formed simple epithelial linings 
 Furthermore, 
            the transfectants produced the CA125 tumor antigen and shed it into 
            the culture medium 
 CA125 is produced by metaplastic OSE in vivo, 
            and a sustained, high level of this antigen in a patient's serum is 
            an indicator of ovarian carcinoma (24) 
 However, CA125 also is a 
            normal differentiation product of endometrial, oviductal, and 
            endocervical epithelia, which metaplastic OSE resembles both 
            histologically and cytologically (25) 
 Therefore, E-cadherin 
            expression restored some characteristics of normal OSE that had been 
            lost in culture, and it initiated a metaplastic, epithelialized 
            phenotype that shares some characteristics with neoplastic OSE

            Cell Culture and Transfection 
 The IOSE-29 cell line (referred to as 
            IOSE-Mar in previous publications) was generated by transfecting 
            normal human OSE cells in passage 5 with the immortalizing simian 
            virus 40 virus early genes (26) 
 IOSE-29 cells lack keratin because 
            they have undergone epitheliomesenchymal conversion, which is 
            typical of cultured OSE (8) 
 IOSE-29 cells at passage 11 were 
            cotransfected (Lipofectamine 
 Life Technologies) with pSV2neo (27) 
            and a full-length mouse E-cadherin cDNA under the control of the 
            Î²-actin promoter (28) 
 The cells were selected under G418 (50 
            Î¼g/ml), which generated a heterogeneous population of cells, 
            designated IOSE-29pre-EC 
 A homogeneous epithelial population then 
            was selected by differential adhesion 
 Briefly, after trypsinization 
            G418-selected cells were allowed to adhere to tissue culture dishes 
            for 30 min and unattached cells were removed by gentle pipette 
            flushing 
 The adherent epithelial population was designated 
            IOSE-29EC 
 Parental cells sham-transfected with SV2neo alone were 
            designated IOSE-29neo 
 Parental and sham-transfected cells yielded 
            no epithelial colonies after differential adhesion 
 Control cell 
            lines used included human ovarian carcinoma OVCAR-3 cells, which 
            express human E-cadherin and CA125 (29) mouse mammary epithelial 
            scp2 cells, which express mouse E-cadherin (30) human cervical 
            carcinoma C4-II cells (31), which express the cytokeratins 7, 8, 18, 
            and 19 that are found in normal OSEin vivo (8) and canine kidney 
            epithelial MDCK cells, which express tight junctional occludin 
 For 
            monolayer culture, cells were maintained on tissue culture dishes 
            (Falcon 
 Life Technologies) in a 1:1 mixture of 199/MCDB 105 medium 
            (Sigma) supplemented with 5% FBS 
 For three-dimensional culture, 
            cells were maintained in pig-skin-derived, dehydrated collagenous 
            sponge matrices (ref 32 
 Spongostan, Health Design Industries, 
            Rochester NY) or reconstituted basement membrane gels (Matrigel 
            Collaborative Research)
            Immunofluorescence, Immunocytochemistry, and Immunoblotting 
 For 
            immunofluorescence, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 
            cold methanol, and postfixed in cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for all 
            antigens except the catenins, which were fixed in buffered 
            paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with digitonin 
 The 
            cells were incubated with antibodies that recognize both human and 
            mouse E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal 
 Transduction Laboratories, 
            Lexington, KY), Î±-catenin (rabbit polyclonal 
 Sigma), Î²- and 
            Î³-catenins (mouse monoclonals, Transduction Laboratories), or 
            pan-cytokeratin (rabbit polyclonal, Dako) 
 Binding of primary 
            antibodies was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy after 
            incubation with fluorescently labeled, species-specific second 
            antibodies 
 F-actin was assessed by using rhodamine phalloidin 
            (Molecular Probes) 
 For CA125 immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed 
            in 10% buffered formalin, incubated with the mAb OC-125, and 
            processed as described (33)
            For E-cadherin and catenin immunoblotting, whole-cell RIPA lysates 
            (01% SDS/1% deoxycholate/1% NP-40) were separated by 10% SDS/PAGE, 
            transferred to nylon membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with the 
            primary antibodies described above as well as a mouse monoclonal 
            that is specific for human E-cadherin (HECD-1 
 Zymed) (34) 
 Antibody 
            binding was visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham 
            Pharmacia) 
 For keratin immunoblotting, 30 Î¼g of solubilized 
            cytoskeletal protein was separated by 85% SDS/PAGE, transferred to 
            membranes, and probed with either a 1:1 mixture of AE1/AE3 mAbs, 
            which, together, detect all basic and acidic cytokeratins (CKs) 
            except CK-18 (31), or an anti-CK-18-specific mAb (Boehringer 
            Mannheim) 
 For CA125 immunoblotting, cell lysates (100 Î¼g 01% 
            Tween 20) or conditioned medium (300 Î¼g) from subconfluent cultures 
            was separated on nondenaturing 5% SDS/PAGE gels, transferred to 
            membranes, and immunoblotted with OC-125 as described (35) 
 CA125 
            levels also were assessed by microparticle enzyme immunoassay per 
            the manufacturer's specifications (Abbott)

             RESULTS 
             
            In monolayer culture, normal human OSE cells, which lack E-cadherin, 
            frequently undergo a mesenchymal conversion (8) 
 The cells become 
            fibroblastic and stop expressing cytokeratins 
 This mesenchymal 
            phenotype is maintained in OSE cell lines whose lifespan has been 
            extended by the simian virus 40 large T antigen (26) 
 The IOSE-29 
            line is a typical example, because it lacks E-cadherin (Figs 1 and 
            2 A) and forms fibroblastic monolayers (Fig 3 A) that are 
            keratin-negative (Fig 4 C) 
            In the present study, IOSE-29 cells were cotransfected with a mouse 
            E-cadherin cDNA and a pSV2neo selection vector 
 After selection 
            under G418, the resulting population, designated IOSE-29pre-EC, was 
            heterogeneous, containing mostly fibroblastic cells that were 
            interspersed with small, compact epithelial islands 
 The epithelial 
            cells, which were slow-growing compared with the fibroblastic cells, 
            were not amenable to limited dilution cloning but they adhered to 
            tissue culture dishes very rapidly after passaging 
 Therefore, we 
            used a differential adhesion strategy (see Materials and Methods) to 
            produce an homogeneous epithelial population, designated IOSE-29EC 
            Differential adhesion of the parental untransfected IOSE-29 cells 
            and sham-transfected IOSE-29neo cells did not generate epithelial 
            populations
            To rule out the possibility that the IOSE-29EC cells might have 
            represented a minor variant of the parental population that 
            expressed endogenous human E-cadherin rather than the exogenous 
            mouse E-cadherin cDNA, we carried out Western blotting with two 
            different E-cadherin antibodies (Fig 1 A) 
 The blots were probed 
            with an antibody that recognizes both human and mouse E-cadherin 
            (Fig 1 A Upper) 
 Control cell lines that express human (lane 1) and 
            mouse (lane 2) E-cadherin were both positive when using this 
            antibody, parental IOSE-29 (lane 3) and IOSE-29neo (lane 4) cells 
            were both negative, and IOSE-29pre-EC (lane 5) and IOSE-29EC (lane 
            6) cells were both positive 
 In Fig 1 A (Lower), which was probed 
            with an antibody that specifically recognizes only human E-cadherin 
            (34), none of the OSE cell lines, either untransfected or 
            transfected, was positive 
 Therefore, we conclude that the 
            IOSE-29pre-EC and IOSE-29EC cells expressed exogenous mouse 
            E-cadherin 
 Interestingly, however, we found that after repeated 
            passaging, IOSE-29EC, but not untransfected IOSE-29 or the 
            sham-transfected IOSE-29neo cells, began to express human E-cadherin 
            (data not shown) 
 This raises the intriguing possibility that 
            E-cadherin can positively regulate its own expression in OSE cells
            When Western blots were overloaded with 100 Î¼g of total protein we 
            still could not detect the 120-kDa E-cadherin in the parental 
            IOSE-29 cells (Fig 1 B), and the protein was not observed by 
            immunofluorescence staining (Fig 2 A) 
 In contrast, E-cadherin was 
            present and appropriately localized at areas of cellâ€“cell contact in 
            the IOSE-29EC cells (Figs 1 B and 2 B) 
 Although parental IOSE-29 
            cells contained detectable levels of the 102-kDa Î±-catenin and the 
            94-kDa Î²-catenin (Fig 1 B), both proteins were dispersed throughout 
            the cell and they were only discontinuously located at sites of 
            cellâ€“cell contact (Fig 2 C and E) 
 The steady-state levels of 
            Î±-catenin and Î²-catenin were increased significantly in IOSE-29EC 
            cells (Fig 1 B), and both proteins were localized almost 
            exclusively at cellâ€“cell contacts (Fig 2 D and F) 
 Parental IOSE-29 
            cells contained very little of the 86-kDa Î³-catenin (Figs 1 B and 2 
            G), but this protein was induced in the IOSE-29EC cells and it was 
            also located at cellâ€“cell contacts (Fig 2 H) 
 F-actin was localized 
            in prominent mesenchymal cytoplasmic stress fibers in IOSE-29 cells 
            (Fig 2 I), but it was redistributed to areas of cellâ€“cell contact 
            in IOSE-29EC cells (Fig 2 J) 
 The colocalization of E-cadherin, all 
            three catenins, and F-actin at cellâ€“cell contacts indicates that the 
            IOSE-29EC cells formed functional epithelial adherens junctions 
            (11) 
 At no time did we observe epithelial cellâ€“cell junction 
            formation in the sham-transfected IOSE-29neo cells (data not shown) 

            Adherens junctions link epithelial cells into cohesive, cobblestone 
            monolayers 
 The mesenchymal IOSE-29 cells were fibroblastic at low 
            cell density (Fig 3 A), and at high cell density the bipolar shape 
            of the cells was accentuated (Fig 3 C) 
 On the other hand, 
            IOSE-29EC cells were packed closely and epithelial at low cell 
            density (Fig 3 B), and at high cell density they formed cobblestone 
            monolayers with bulging hemicystic domes (Fig 3 D) 
 The presence of 
            domes suggested that IOSE-29EC cells formed tight junctions (see 
            Fig 4) 
            The mesenchymal characteristics of the parental IOSE-29 line were 
            clearly evident in three-dimensional sponge culture (Fig 3 E) 
 The 
            cells migrated into the spaces between the sponge spicules, which 
            likely reflects their ability to deposit a stromal extracellular 
            matrix (4, 32) 
 In contrast, IOSE-29EC cells formed simple epithelia 
            that lined the sponge spicules (Fig 3 F) 
 Morphological differences 
            between the parent and transfected lines also were apparent in 
            three-dimensional basement membrane gels 
 Under these conditions, 
            the IOSE-29 cells formed cell aggregates with radiating branching 
            cords that invaded the gel (Fig 3 G) whereas IOSE-29EC cells formed 
            tightly packed epithelial spheres with no evidence of invasion (Fig 
            3 H)
            The morphology of the E-cadherin-transfected cells suggested that 
            they were functionally epithelialized 
 To confirm this tentative 
            conclusion we examined cytokeratin expression 
 As expected (8, 26), 
            the mesenchymal IOSE-29 cells did not express CK (Fig 4 A and C) 
            The same was true of the sham-transfected IOSE-29neo cells (data not 
            shown) 
 On the other hand, IOSE-29EC cells contained the simple 
            epithelial CK7, CK18, and CK 19 (Fig 4 A), which formed classical 
            intermediate filament arrays (Fig 4 D) 
 We also examined the 
            tight-junction protein occludin (36) 
 IOSE-29EC cells, but not the 
            parental line, expressed significant amounts of occludin (Fig 4 B), 
            which was localized at sites of cellâ€“cell contact (Fig 4 E and F) 
            These data, and the formation of domes in monolayer culture, 
            indicated the presence of tight junctions in the epithelialized 
            IOSE-29EC cells
            Unlike Mullerian duct-derived epithelia, normal OSE cells do not 
            express the CA 125 tumor antigen in vivo or in culture (25, 33) 
 The 
            same was true of both IOSE-29 (Fig 5 A and B) and sham-transfected 
            IOSE-29neo cells (data not shown) 
 In contrast, broad-molecular-mass 
            CA125-containing protein species between approximately 500 and 700 
            kDa were found in IOSE-29EC cell lysates and conditioned medium 
            (Fig 5 A) 
 It should be noted, however, that the CA125 shed into 
            the medium by IOSE-29EC cells was qualitatively different from that 
            produced by OVCAR-3 carcinoma cells, which suggests that there may 
            be differences in CA125 glycosylation by the two cell lines 
 The 
            CA125 tumor antigen also was detected on the surface of IOSE-29EC 
            cells by immunocytochemistry (Fig 5 C) and in cell lysates and 
            conditioned medium by using the microparticle enzyme immunoassay 
            (Table 1) 
 The latter levels were comparable to those of OVCAR-3 
            carcinoma cells 
 Therefore, the evidence was overwhelming that CA125 
            was being produced by the epithelialized IOSE-29EC cells, indicating 
            that exogenous E-cadherin expression induced an aberrant Mullerian 
            duct-like differentiation that is a hallmark of OSE metaplasia and 
            neoplasia

             DISCUSSION 
             
            The genetic basis for familial predisposition to epithelial ovarian 
            cancer is now being elucidated (36â€“39) 
 However, in both familial 
            and sporadic ovarian cancers, definitive premalignant lesions have 
            not been identified 
 As a result, at the time of diagnosis the 
            disease often has progressed to its later stages and the prognosis 
            is invariably poor 
 In the present study we examined the basis of 
            the metaplastic and early neoplastic changes that occur in the OSE, 
            the presumptive target tissue in ovarian carcinogenesis, in an 
            effort to identify early predictive markers of these neoplasms 
 The 
            results present an unexpected role for E-cadherin in carcinogenesis 
            and identify a differentiation-related step that seems to contribute 
            to early ovarian neoplastic progression
            The OSE arises from the urogenital coelomic epithelium, as do the 
            Mullerian duct-derived epithelia that line the oviduct, endometrium, 
            and endocervix 
 However, unlike Mullerian duct-derived epithelia, 
            normal OSE rarely contains the epithelial cellâ€“cell adhesion 
            molecule E-cadherin (5â€“7) 
 Normal OSE do express N-cadherin (23, 
            40), which is a cell-adhesion molecule that can cause cellâ€“cell 
            junction disassembly and cell migration when it is expressed 
            inappropriately (41) 
 Thus, the presence of N-cadherin in normal OSE 
            cells may contribute to their propensity to undergo mesenchymal 
            conversion in culture 
 In this study, the mesenchymal 
            characteristics of the normal IOSE-29 line were readily apparent in 
            three-dimensional sponge culture in which fibroblastic, bipolar 
            cells migrated into the spaces between the sponge spicules
            In vivo, Mullerian metaplasia of OSE is common, and it usually has 
            little or no pathological consequence (2) 
 However, the incidence of 
            metaplasia is increased in women with a familial predisposition to 
            ovarian cancer, and both dysplasia and rare cases of carcinoma have 
            been observed within these lesions (9) 
 In contrast to normal OSE, 
            metaplastic OSE and primary ovarian carcinomas both contain 
            E-cadherin (5â€“7) 
 When we produced cells that expressed high levels 
            of E-cadherin, they were no longer fibroblastic 
 Instead, these 
            cells, designated IOSE-29EC, formed closely packed epithelial 
            monolayers 
 Several lines of evidence indicate that the 
            epithelialization of IOSE-29EC cells was caused by expression of the 
            transfected mouse E-cadherin cDNA and not by the selection of a 
            preexisting subpopulation of metaplastic cells present in the 
            parental line: (i) no E-cadherin positive cells were ever observed 
            in the parental IOSE-29 or sham-transfected IOSE-29neo lines (ii) 
            differential adhesion of IOSE-29 and IOSE-29neo cells never yielded 
            epithelial colonies (iii) cytokeratins and/or CA125 were never 
            observed in IOSE-29 and IOSE-29neo lines, although these markers 
            characterize the IOSE-29EC line (see below) (iv) low levels of 
            E-cadherin were present in IOSE-29preEC cells before differential 
            adhesion and (v) the E-cadherin present in IOSE-29pre-EC and 
            IOSE-29EC cells was the exogenous mouse, not the endogenous human, 
            protein
            Exogenous E-cadherin expression causes a partial epithelial 
            transformation of true fibroblasts, at least with respect to 
            cellâ€“cell junction formation (42, 43) 
 In contrast, epithelial cell 
            junctions were fully developed in IOSE-29EC cells as judged by the 
            following criteria: f-actin was found in plasma membrane-associated 
            circumferential rings 
 E-cadherin, Î±-catenin, Î²-catenin, and 
            Î³-catenin all colocalized with the F-actin rings in adherens 
            junctions and occludin was up-regulated and localized to sites of 
            cellâ€“cell contact, indicating the formation of secondary tight 
            junctions 
 Functionally, these epithelial cell junctions supported 
            vectorial ion transport as IOSE-29EC formed hemicystic domes in 
            high-density monolayer culture 
 Such domes are never found in 
            cultures of normal mesenchymal OSE, but they are common in ovarian 
            carcinoma cultures 
 IOSE-29EC cells also reexpressed cytokeratins, 
            which are found in normal OSEin vivo (8), and they formed epithelial 
            linings on sponge spicules that were reminiscent of metaplastic OSE 
            trapped within surface invaginations and inclusion cysts
            In many types of epithelial tumors, down-regulation or mutation of 
            E-cadherin is associated with an increased invasiveness that can be 
            prevented by the forced expression of the cell-adhesion molecule 
            This suggests that E-cadherin is a late-stage tumor suppressor that 
            prevents invasion and metastasis (14) 
 Because E-cadherin is 
            expressed in most epithelia, it is assumed that its presence in 
            primary, differentiated tumors is a characteristic of the target 
            tissue that has been retained during the early stages of 
            carcinogenesis 
 However, the frequent presence of E-cadherin in 
            primary ovarian carcinomas (18â€“23) must be acquired during 
            carcinogenesis because it is rarely present in normal OSE (5â€“7) 
            Although the subsequent loss of E-cadherin undoubtedly plays a role 
            in late-stage ovarian metastasis, our data suggest that ectopic 
            expression of the cell-adhesion molecule initiates early 
            preneoplastic changes by committing OSE cells to a more complex 
            epithelial phenotype that restricts their mesenchymal potential 
            From a mechanistic point of view this phenotypic modulation could be 
            mediated by changes in the subcellular localization of Î²-catenin 
            (11â€“13)
            An important phenotypic consequence of OSE epithelialization in 
            IOSE-29EC cells was the secretion of the CA125 tumor antigen 
 In 
            vivo, CA125 is produced by metaplastic OSE, and high levels of the 
            antigen in a patient's serum is an indicator of ovarian carcinoma 
            (25) 
 We recently have produced a second E-cadherin-transfected IOSE 
            line derived independently from a separate normal human donor that 
            also produces CA125 (data not shown) 
 Thus, the E-cadherin-induced 
            CA125 tumor antigen production observed in IOSE-29EC cells was not a 
            unique, isolated event
            The CA125 tumor antigen is a normal differentiation product of 
            oviductal, endometrial, and endocervical epithelia 
 Therefore, our 
            finding that E-cadherin-induced CA125 production in OSE cells puts 
            to rest any lingering doubts regarding this tissue's ability to 
            acquire the Mullerian characteristics observed in metaplastic OSE 
            and ovarian carcinomas 
 The mechanism by which E-cadherin induces 
            CA125 production in OSE cells remains unclear because the gene that 
            codes the core protein has not yet been cloned, probably because, 
            until now, it has not been possible to regulate the gene's 
            expression 
 Taken together, our results demonstrate that the 
            expression of exogenous E-cadherin in mesenchymal IOSE-29 cells not 
            only restored the epithelial properties of normal OSE but, in 
            addition, induced novel characteristics of metaplastic and 
            neoplastic OSE such as tight junctions and CA125 production 
 Thus, 
            as is not the case in the great majority of other epithelial 
            tissues, the ectopic expression of E-cadherin frequently observed in 
            metaplastic and neoplastic OSE may play a functional role in the 
            earliest stages of ovarian tumor development
