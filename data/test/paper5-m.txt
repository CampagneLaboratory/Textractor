Down-Regulation of -Catenin by Activated <term>p53</term> Einat Sadot, Benjamin Geiger, Moshe Oren, and Avri Ben-Ze'ev* Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel Received 6 February 2001/Returned for modification 5 April 2001/Accepted 9 July 2001          ABSTRACT       Top        Abstract        Introduction        Materials and Methods        Results        Discussion        References -Catenin is a cytoplasmic protein that participates in the assembly of cell-cell adherens junctions by binding cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, it is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Activation of this pathway triggers the accumulation of <term>-catenin</term> in the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of target genes. Abnormal accumulation of <term>-catenin</term> is characteristic of various types of cancer and is caused by <term>mutations</term> either in the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, which regulates <term>-catenin</term> degradation, or in the <term>-catenin</term> molecule itself. Aberrant accumulation of <term>-catenin</term> in tumors is often associated with mutational inactivation of the <term>p53</term> tumor suppressor. Here we show that overexpression of wild-type <term>p53</term>  by either transfection or DNA damage, down-regulates <term>-catenin</term> in <term>human</term> and mouse cells. This effect was not obtained with transcriptionally inactive <term>p53</term>  including a common tumor-associated <term>p53</term> mutant. The reduction in <term>-catenin</term> level was accompanied by inhibition of its transactivation potential. The inhibitory effect of <term>p53</term> on <term>-catenin</term> is apparently mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and requires an active glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Mutations in the N terminus of <term>-catenin</term> which compromise its degradation by the proteasomes, overexpression of dominant-negative F--TrCP, or inhibition of GSK <term>activity</term> all rendered <term>-catenin</term> resistant to down-regulation by p53. These findings support the notion that there will be a selective pressure for the loss of wild-type <term>p53</term> expression in cancers that are driven by excessive accumulation of -catenin.          INTRODUCTION       Top        Abstract        Introduction        Materials and Methods        Results        Discussion        References -Catenin plays a dual role in cells as a major structural component of cell-cell adherens junctions and as a pivotal signaling molecule in the Wnt pathway, transmitting transcriptional cues into the nucleus. In adherens junctions, <term>-catenin</term> bridges between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton through an interaction with <term>-catenin</term> (2, 10). Either the nonjunctional pool of <term>-catenin</term> is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or, under certain conditions, <term>-catenin</term> enters the nucleus and, together with lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor transcription factors (9, 34, 56), activates transcription by providing the transactivation domain to this heterodimeric complex (82). The targeting of <term>-catenin</term> to the proteasome is achieved primarily through its phosphorylation by a multimolecular complex consisting of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein, and axin (38). The phosphoserine motif in the N terminus of <term>-catenin</term> (91) is recognized by -TrCP, an F-box component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCFTrCP (29, 41, 46, 71, 88). Activation of the Wnt/wg signaling pathway leads to inhibition of <term>-catenin</term> degradation by decreasing the ability of GSK3 to phosphorylate -catenin. This reduces its susceptibility to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to its accumulation (93). Studies in recent years have suggested that <term>-catenin</term> is a potent oncogene product (64), and its accumulation has been implicated in tumorigenesis in a wide variety of <term>human</term> cancers (65, 66, 94). In colorectal cancer (CRC) the increase in <term>-catenin</term> level is attributed to <term>mutations</term> in APC, which occur in about 80% of such tumors (55, 65). Accumulation of <term>-catenin</term> can also be triggered by <term>mutations</term> in the <term>-catenin</term> gene itself, affecting the amino-terminal region of the protein that contains the GSK3 phosphorylation sites (57, 70). Such <term>mutations</term> are frequent in colon cancers retaining a wild-type  <term>wt</term>  APC gene (66) and are also prevalent in melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and a variety of other tumors (13, 16, 22-24, 36, 42, 43, 54, 70, 83, 87, 89, 95). The mechanism responsible for -catenin-associated tumorigenesis is suggested to involve -catenin- and LEF-1/TCF-activated genes, including genes that control the cell cycle (such as those for cyclin D1 [73, 80] and c-myc [32]), genes that are involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions (such as those for matrilysin [14], fibronectin [26], and WISP-1 [90]), and genes for various transcription factors, including Tcf-1 (68), c-jun and fra-1 (48), and PPAR (31). The oncogenic role of <term>-catenin</term> is also supported by studies showing that introduction of <term>mutant</term> APC, or <term>-catenin</term>  into transgenic mice results in enhanced tumor formation (25, 27, 63). Another protein which is implicated in many types of cancer is p53. Mutations in the <term>p53</term> gene are found in about 50% of <term>human</term> cancers (reviewed in references 45 and 61). Under normal conditions, <term>p53</term> is most probably latent, owing to its rapid ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation. Mdm2, an oncoprotein possessing E3 ubiquitin ligase <term>activity</term>  plays a major role in this process (5, 61). A variety of conditions can lead to the rapid stabilization and activation of p53. These include damage to DNA or to the mitotic spindle, ribonucleotide depletion, hypoxia, heat shock, and exposure to nitric oxide (4, 35, 45, 61). In addition, <term>p53</term> is induced by several oncogenic proteins, such as myc, ras, and adenovirus E1A, providing a direct link between oncogenic processes and the tumor suppressor action of <term>p53</term> (reviewed in references 3, 35, 45, and 61). The activation of <term>p53</term> by these proteins relies mainly on ARF, a tumor suppressor protein that binds to Mdm2 and suppresses its <term>p53</term> ubiquitination <term>activity</term>  thereby inhibiting <term>p53</term> degradation (72). Activated <term>p53</term> can affect the cell cycle, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, cell differentiation, and angiogenesis (35, 76), mostly via its function as a transcription factor that activates a number of target genes and by its interaction with a variety of proteins. Some of the better-studied <term>p53</term> target genes are those for p21 (WAF1), which is mainly involved in G1 arrest; GADD45 and 14-3-3, which contribute to G2 arrest; and BAX, Fas (APO1), PIG3, and KILLER (DR5), which lead to caspase activation and apoptosis (12, 18). A possible cross talk between <term>p53</term> and <term>-catenin</term> is suggested by the observation that cancers accumulating <term>-catenin</term> (as a result of APC <term>mutations</term>  also exhibit a high frequency of <term>p53</term> <term>mutations</term>  which was first illustrated by the analysis of <term>human</term> CRC (40). Direct evidence for a cross talk between <term>-catenin</term> and <term>p53</term> was recently provided by studies demonstrating that excess <term>-catenin</term> can induce an accumulation of active <term>p53</term> (15). This may explain, at least in part, the selective pressure for loss of <term>p53</term> <term>activity</term> in tumors harboring deregulated <term>-catenin</term>  such as CRC and HCC. To elucidate why retention of functional <term>p53</term> is disadvantageous to such tumors, we studied the effect of <term>p53</term> on the level and transcriptional <term>activity</term> of -catenin. We report here that elevated <term>levels</term> of <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term> down-regulate <term>-catenin</term> in a variety of cell types. This down-regulation depends on the integrity and functionality of <term>p53</term> and is not observed with a common tumor-associated <term>p53</term> mutant. Moreover, this effect of <term>p53</term> is exerted on <term>wt</term> <term>-catenin</term> but not on the stable S33Y <term>-catenin</term> <term>mutant</term>  and it is blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, a dominant-negative component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex F--TrCP, and by LiCl, which inhibits GSK3 activity. Furthermore, <term>p53</term> can lead to a decrease in the level of the endogenous <term>wt</term> <term>-catenin</term> in SW480 cells but not in that of the S45 <term>-catenin</term> <term>mutant</term> of HCT116 cells. Together with the observations of Damalas et al. (15), our findings outline a negative feedback control involving <term>-catenin</term> and <term>p53</term>  where excess <term>-catenin</term> induces the accumulation of <term>p53</term>  while high <term>p53</term> <term>levels</term> down-regulate -catenin. Disruption of this feedback loop likely affects tumorigenesis driven by deregulated <term>-catenin</term> <term>activity</term> and may therefore underlie the high frequency of <term>p53</term> inactivation observed in CRC, HCC, and probably other types of cancer.          MATERIALS AND METHODS       Top        Abstract        Introduction        Materials and Methods        Results        Discussion        References Cells and transfections. The HCT116 and SW480 <term>human</term> colon carcinoma cell lines, the <term>human</term> H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cell line, and the 293 adenovirus-transformed <term>human</term> embryo kidney cell line were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (BCS). <term>wt</term> mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEF), p53/ MEF, and double-mutant p53/ Mdm2/ MEF (15) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% BCS, 100 µM nonessential amino acid mixture (Biological Industries Israel), and 50 µM -mercaptoethanol. WI38 normal <term>human</term> embryonic lung fibroblasts were cultured in minimum essential medium with 20% BCS. For transfections, cells were plated to form a 50 to 70% confluent culture in a 30-mm-diameter dish. The SW480 and HCT116 cell lines were transfected using Lipofectamine (GIBCO BRL), while the 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. The treatment with 30 mM LiCl in some experiments was overnight, the treatment with 10 µM MG132 was for 4 h, and the treatment with 5 µg of doxorubicin (DOX) per ml or 5 µg of cisplatin per ml was for periods ranging from 2 to 48 h. Plasmids. The following expression plasmids encoding various <term>p53</term> constructs were employed: mouse <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term> (20), mouse <term>mutant</term> p5313-52 (30), hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged <term>human</term> <term>p53</term> (HA-p53) (50), <term>human</term> <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term> (7), and the <term>human</term> R175H <term>mutant</term> <term>p53</term> (7, 60). The reporter plasmid containing the cyclin G promoter-luciferase (30), the LEF/TCF reporter plasmids TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH (82), the F--TrCP-expressing plasmid (71), and the vectors expressing various <term>-catenin</term> forms (HA--catenin, HA-S33Y <term>-catenin</term>  and vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV]--catenin) (73, 74, 93) were as described previously. Protein analysis. Protein <term>levels</term> were monitored by Western blotting. The following antibodies were used. Polyclonal anti--catenin and monoclonal antivinculin were from Sigma; monoclonal anti--catenin (clone 14c19220) was from Transduction Laboratories. The 14c19220 antibody was generated against amino acids 571 to 781 and recognizes the caspase-cleaved 65-kDa product of <term>-catenin</term> (11, 81). Monoclonal antibodies against <term>p53</term> included anti-human <term>p53</term> DO1 (84), PAb1801 (8), anti-mouse <term>p53</term> (which cross-reacts with <term>human</term> <term>p53</term> , and PAb421 (28). A polyclonal anti-p53 was kindly provided by Varda Rotter, Weizmann Institute of Science). Monoclonal anti-HA clone 12CA5 way from Boehringer Mannheim), and polyclonal anti-HA Y11 sc-805 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Fractionation of proteins into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions was performed as previously described (71), and equal volumes of lysates from the two fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Western blots were developed using the ECL method (Amersham). Autoradiograms were scanned with a GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using the FotoLook PS 2.07.2 software. The intensity of the bands was quantitated using the NIH image 1.61 software. Luciferase assay For transactivation assays, 1 µg of luciferase reporter plasmid was cotransfected with 2 µg of the <term>-catenin</term> construct and 2 µg of the various <term>p53</term> constructs, as indicated. A -galactosidase-expressing vector was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After 24 h, the cells were lysed and both luciferase and -galactosidase activities were determined with enzyme assay kits (Promega). Luminescence was quantitated using a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Design) from duplicate plates. The results represent data from at least five independent experiments. Immunofluorescence microscopy Cells were cultured on glass coverslips, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The coverslips were incubated with the primary antibodies as described above. The secondary antibodies were Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Images were acquired using the DeltaVision system (Applied Precision) equipped with a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axiovert 100 microscope and a Photometrics (Tucson, Ariz.) 300 series scientific-grade cooled charge-coupled device camera (reading 12-bit images), using a 100×, 1.3 numerical-aperture plan-Neofluar objective (Zeiss). For quantitative image processing, the Priism software was employed (37). At least 50 transfected and 50 nontransfected cells were examined in each experiment.          RESULTS       Top        Abstract        Introduction        Materials and Methods        Results        Discussion        References Excess <term>p53</term> reduces <term>-catenin</term> protein <term>levels</term> Since recent studies have shown that excess <term>-catenin</term> can promote the accumulation of <term>p53</term> (15), we examined the possibility that there is a reciprocal relationship between <term>p53</term> and -catenin. We have addressed this question by monitoring the level of endogenous <term>-catenin</term> in cells in which <term>p53</term> was induced by DNA damage. MEF from <term>wt</term> mice (p53+/+) and from <term>p53</term> knockout mice (p53/) were treated for 24 h with 5 µg of DOX per ml, which effectively induces <term>p53</term> stabilization and accumulation (4). DOX treatment elicited a strong nuclear <term>p53</term> accumulation in the p53+/+ MEF (Fig. 1C; compare to Fig. 1A). -Catenin was present in the cytoplasm and adherens junctions in both p53+/+ and p53/ cells before DOX treatment (Fig. 1B and F), but following DOX treatment, adherens junctions were disrupted in both cell types (Fig. 1D and H). However, while in p53/ MEF the intensity of <term>-catenin</term> staining remained unchanged and the protein was strongly visible in the cytoplasm and at the edges of the disrupted junctions (Fig. 1H), in p53+/+ MEF <term>-catenin</term> staining was significantly reduced in the majority of cells (Fig. 1D). During the 24 h of DOX treatment, no morphological signs of apoptosis were observed in these cells (Fig. 1C, D, G, and H and data not shown).To quantify the effect of <term>p53</term> on <term>-catenin</term> <term>levels</term>  cell lysates isolated after 0, 2, 8, 16, and 24 h of DOX treatment were immunoblotted with anti--catenin antibody. To distinguish between free cytosolic and cytoskeletal or nuclear <term>-catenin</term>  cells were fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble and Triton X-insoluble pools (Fig. 2A). In p53+/+ MEF, <term>p53</term> <term>levels</term> peaked at 16 h after DOX treatment and declined at later times (Fig. 2A). This <term>p53</term> was largely Triton insoluble, reflecting its nuclear accumulation. -Catenin, in both the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions, decreased considerably after 24 h of DOX treatment (Fig. 2A and A'), while no significant decrease in the vinculin level was observed under these conditions (Fig. 2A and A'). In contrast, in p53/ MEF neither <term>-catenin</term> nor vinculin <term>levels</term> decreased following DOX treatment (Fig. 2B and B'). When <term>p53</term> expression was induced by cisplatin treatment of p53+/+ MEF (Fig. 2C), a comparable decrease in <term>-catenin</term> was observed (Fig. 2C'). Cisplatin did not induce a detectable change in <term>-catenin</term> <term>levels</term> of p53/ MEF (Fig. 2D and D'). The effect of <term>p53</term> on <term>-catenin</term> was also observed in normal WI38 <term>human</term> embryonic lung fibroblasts (Fig. 2E). <term>p53</term> was strongly induced in these cells after DOX treatment, and its localization shifted from the Triton X-100-soluble to the Triton-insoluble fraction, probably reflecting its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In these cells, treatment with DOX for 48 h induced a fivefold reduction in the Triton X-100-soluble <term>-catenin</term> (Fig. 2E'), while the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was only moderately affected (Fig. 2E and E'). In contrast, the <term>levels</term> of vinculin in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of these cells did not change significantly (Fig. 2E and E'). Immunofluorescence analysis of WI38 cells treated with DOX for 24 or 48 h revealed intact nuclei and well-spread cells (data not shown), implying that the DOX treatment did not induce apoptosis in these cells.

The intensities of the             bands from representative gels of MEF p53+/+ (A and C) and MEF p53/             (B and D) cells were quantified and plotted (A', C', B', and D',             respectively). Extracts from WI38 cells (E and E') were blotted with             the monoclonal anti--catenin antibody (-cat), vinculin (vin), and a             mixture of the anti-human <term>p53</term> antibodies DO1 and 1801 and analyzed             as described for MEF cells. a.u., arbitrary units. The ability of excess <term>p53</term> to reduce <term>-catenin</term> <term>levels</term> was also observed in 293 cells transfected with a <term>p53</term> expression plasmid (Fig. 3). Transfection of <term>p53</term> into these cells resulted in a major decrease in the level of endogenous Triton X-100-soluble <term>-catenin</term> (which is believed to represent the signaling pool of <term>-catenin</term>  but not in that of vinculin (Fig. 3A). To determine whether <term>p53</term> can also affect the signaling <term>activity</term> of <term>-catenin</term>  <term>p53</term> and <term>-catenin</term> were cotransfected into 293 cells together with the LEF-1 reporter plasmid TOPFLASH (82) or with a variety of control plasmids. The transfected <term>p53</term> was transcriptionally active as seen from its ability to strongly activate the p53-responsive cyclin G promoter (Fig. 3B, bars 1 and 2). The cytomegalovirus promoter, a target for nonspecific repression by high <term>levels</term> of <term>p53</term> (78), was repressed only slightly under these conditions (Fig. 3B, bars 3 and 4), while <term>p53</term> had no effect on the control FOPFLASH reporter plasmid (Fig. 3B, bars 6 and 8). In contrast, <term>p53</term> very strongly suppressed the -catenin-mediated luciferase <term>activity</term> driven from the TOPFLASH reporter (Fig. 3B, bars 11 and 12). Analysis of protein <term>levels</term> revealed that in these cotransfected 293 cells, <term>p53</term> caused a dramatic reduction in the steady-state <term>-catenin</term> <term>levels</term> (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the <term>levels</term> of the closely related HA-plakoglobin protein (94), transduced with the same expression vector, were not affected by <term>p53</term> (Fig. 3C). This specific down-regulation of <term>-catenin</term> is likely responsible for the inhibitory effect of <term>p53</term> on -catenin-dependent transcriptional activity.

The results shown in Fig. 3D clearly demonstrate that when a constant level of <term>p53</term> was cotransfected into H1299 cells with increasing <term>levels</term> of <term>-catenin</term>  the increase in the expression of <term>p53</term> was highest when high <term>levels</term> of <term>-catenin</term> were transfected (Fig. 3D, compare <term>lanes</term> 2 and 3). In contrast, when a constant high level of <term>-catenin</term> was cotransfected with increasing amounts of <term>p53</term>  a decrease in the level of <term>-catenin</term> was already apparent with the initial low level of <term>p53</term> (Fig. 3D, <term>lanes</term> 4 and 5), and a dramatic reduction in <term>-catenin</term> was seen with the higher concentrations of <term>p53</term> (Fig. 3D, <term>lanes</term> 4 to 7). Taken together, these results demonstrate the dose-dependent reciprocal relationship between <term>-catenin</term> and <term>p53</term> expression in the same cells and that <term>p53</term> can reduce the <term>levels</term> and transcriptional <term>activity</term> of <term>-catenin</term>  irrespective of whether <term>-catenin</term> is expressed from the endogenous gene or from an expression plasmid. <term>p53</term> mutants fail to reduce <term>-catenin</term> <term>levels</term> Next, we examined the ability of <term>mutant</term> forms of <term>p53</term> to down-regulate -catenin. Unlike <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term>  which strongly reduced the <term>levels</term> and transcriptional <term>activity</term> of <term>-catenin</term> in 293 cells, the mouse <term>p53</term> deletion <term>mutant</term> p5313-52, which lacks transactivation and Mdm2 binding activities (the transactivation domain is only partially deleted but is apparently nonfunctional) (Fig. 4A), had no detectable effect on <term>-catenin</term> level and transcriptional <term>activity</term> (Fig. 4B and C). Importantly, the cancer-associated hot spot <term>human</term> <term>p53</term> <term>mutant</term> (p53R175H) (7, 60) was also unable to down-regulate <term>-catenin</term> (Fig 4D). The presence of Mdm2 was apparently not required for the p53-mediated reduction in <term>-catenin</term> level, since in double-mutant MEF (deficient in both <term>p53</term> and Mdm2), transfection of <term>p53</term> was still capable of efficiently decreasing <term>-catenin</term> expression (Fig. 4E). Hence, the integrity and functionality of <term>p53</term> are required for its ability to down-regulate <term>-catenin</term> and are apparently independent of Mdm2.

The level of the transfected (HA-tagged) <term>-catenin</term>             was determined by Western blot analysis. The positions of <term>-catenin</term>             and <term>p53</term> are indicated. The asterisks in panels C, D, and E represent             a nonspecific band obtained with the anti-HA antibody. Involvement of GSK3 and the proteasome system in p53-mediated down-regulation of -catenin. The targeting of <term>-catenin</term> to the proteasome is achieved through its phosphorylation by GSK3 in a multiprotein complex, followed by its recognition by -TrCP, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase system (29, 41, 46, 71, 88). To examine whether the reduction in <term>-catenin</term> level by <term>p53</term> requires the <term>activity</term> of GSK3, the effect of <term>p53</term> on <term>-catenin</term> in cells treated with LiCl, which inhibits the <term>activity</term> of GSK3 (91), was determined. As shown in Fig. 5A, incubation with LiCl blocked the ability of <term>p53</term> to lower <term>-catenin</term> <term>levels</term> (Fig. 5A, compare <term>lanes</term> 3 and 4). The effect of <term>p53</term> on cotransfected <term>-catenin</term> was also blocked in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5B, <term>lanes</term> 3 and 4), implying that <term>p53</term> promotes the degradation of <term>-catenin</term> through the proteasome system. Furthermore, <term>p53</term> did not reduce the level of the S33Y <term>mutant</term> <term>-catenin</term>  which is relatively refractory to phosphorylation by GSK3 and hence to proteasomal degradation (21, 29, 46), in either the presence (Fig. 5B, <term>lanes</term> 7 and 8) or in the absence (Fig. 5B, <term>lanes</term> 5 and 6) of MG132. When HA-tagged ubiquitin was cotransfected with <term>-catenin</term> in the presence or absence of <term>p53</term>  an increase in ubiquitinated <term>-catenin</term> was detected in immunoprecipitates obtained from cells overexpressing <term>p53</term> (data not shown). Further support for the notion that <term>p53</term> overexpression stimulates <term>-catenin</term> degradation via the classical Wnt pathway was obtained from cotransfection of 293 cells with F--TrCP, which binds to serine-phosphorylated <term>-catenin</term> and blocks its degradation (71). As shown in Fig. 5C, expression of F--TrCP partially blocked the p53-induced reduction in <term>-catenin</term> levels. These results suggest that <term>p53</term> can promote the turnover of <term>-catenin</term> by augmenting its -TrCP-mediated proteasomal degradation and that typical oncogenic <term>mutations</term> of <term>-catenin</term> (such as the S33Y mutation) can render it resistant to high <term>levels</term> of p53.

The transfected <term>wt</term>             <term>-catenin</term> was detected by anti-VSV antibody, while F--TrCP expression             was monitored with an anti-HA tag antibody. The asterisk indicates a             nonspecific band obtained with the anti-HA antibody. <term>p53</term> can repress <term>wt</term> but not <term>mutant</term> <term>-catenin</term> in colon cancer cell lines. The SW480 CRC cell line expresses a truncated APC that is deficient in its ability to promote <term>-catenin</term> degradation (58). Nevertheless, these cells contain phosphorylated <term>-catenin</term> that coprecipitates with the E3 ubiquitin ligase component -TrCP (29), suggesting that the proteasomal degradation pathway responsible for <term>-catenin</term> turnover is only partially attenuated in these cells.

The analysis of the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions from these cells also failed to reveal a significant change in <term>-catenin</term> <term>levels</term> (Fig. 7E and F).

The presence of deregulated <term>mutant</term> <term>-catenin</term> in HCT116 cells results in constitutive -catenin-mediated transcriptional <term>activity</term> (Fig. 8A, lane 7). In contrast to the case in SW480 cells, excess <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term> failed to inhibit the transcriptional <term>activity</term> of the endogenous <term>mutant</term> (S45) <term>-catenin</term> in HCT116 cells (Fig. 8A, lane 8 [compare to lane 7]). However, <term>p53</term> repressed transactivation driven by excess transfected <term>wt</term> <term>-catenin</term> (Fig. 8A, <term>lanes</term> 9 and 10). This inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in the level of the transfected <term>wt</term> <term>-catenin</term> (Fig. 8A, <term>lanes</term> 9 and 10). In contrast, transfection of the more stable tumor-associated <term>mutant</term> <term>-catenin</term> S33Y resulted in augmented transactivation that was resistant to <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term> coexpression (Fig. 8A, <term>lanes</term> 11 and 12). We also examined the ability of the endogenous <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term> in HCT116 cells to affect -catenin-mediated transactivation by inducing <term>p53</term> expression with DOX. The results demonstrate that increasing endogenous <term>p53</term> <term>levels</term> by this approach led to the inhibition of transactivation driven by the transfected <term>wt</term> <term>-catenin</term> (Fig. 8B, compare bars 5 and 10 to bar 4) but not by the <term>mutant</term> endogenous S45 <term>-catenin</term> or the transfected <term>mutant</term> <term>-catenin</term> S33Y, which were resistant to elevated <term>p53</term> (Fig, 8B, compare bars 4 to 10 and 6 to 12). These results suggest that the cellular machinery necessary for the inhibitory effect of <term>p53</term> on <term>-catenin</term> is intact in HCT116 cells and that the inability of <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term> to down-regulate the endogenous <term>-catenin</term> (S45) or the transfected S33Y is due to the N-terminal <term>mutations</term> in the serine motifs that regulate <term>-catenin</term> degradation.

Transactivation driven by the FOPFLASH and TOPFLASH reporter             plasmids was determined. The standard error is shown. Taken together, the results imply that <term>mutations</term> within the GSK3 phosphorylation domain of <term>-catenin</term> that render it more resistant to proteasomal degradation also make <term>-catenin</term> more resistant to down-regulation by activated p53. Importantly, such <term>-catenin</term> <term>mutations</term> are prevalent in a variety of <term>human</term> cancers.          DISCUSSION       Top        Abstract        Introduction        Materials and Methods        Results        Discussion        References This study demonstrated that high <term>levels</term> of functional <term>p53</term> could down-regulate the amount and transcriptional <term>activity</term> of -catenin. This effect was eliminated by blocking the activities of components that regulate the turnover of <term>-catenin</term>  such as GSK3, a dominant-negative form of -TrCP, and the proteasomal system. <term>p53</term> therefore most probably exerted its effect by accelerating the degradation of <term>-catenin</term> by the proteasome. While <term>p53</term> could down-regulate <term>wt</term> <term>-catenin</term> in the presence of <term>wt</term> or even <term>mutant</term> APC, it failed to affect mutants of <term>-catenin</term> that are resistant to the APC-GSK3-axin-mediated degradation. It is unlikely that the basal low <term>levels</term> of <term>p53</term> in nonstressed cells are sufficient to cause <term>-catenin</term> down-regulation. Rather, it is conceivable that this inhibitory effect is exerted only by high <term>levels</term> of activated <term>p53</term>  as seen in cells exposed to extensive genotoxic stress (Fig. 2). Constitutive <term>activity</term> of <term>-catenin</term> can exert both proliferative and antiapoptotic effects (62). Hence, the down-regulation of <term>-catenin</term> by activated <term>p53</term> is likely to contribute to the antiproliferative effects of <term>p53</term> and possibly also facilitates p53-mediated apoptosis. While in our experiments <term>p53</term> activation was attained by treatment of cultured cells with DNA-damaging agents, it is conceivable that a similar situation may pertain also in emerging colorectal tumors with multiple genomic aberrations, which is typical of late stages in colorectal carcinogenesis. The exact molecular mechanism responsible for the down-regulation of <term>-catenin</term> by <term>p53</term> remains to be elucidated. So far, we have been unable to demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction between <term>p53</term> and <term>-catenin</term> (data not shown), suggesting that additional proteins are likely to play a role in mediating <term>-catenin</term> down-regulation. <term>p53</term> is a transcription factor, which is capable of direct sequence-specific transcription activation and indirect, albeit target gene selective, transcriptional repression. We have shown that <term>p53</term> mutants deficient in transcriptional <term>activity</term>  owing either to deletion of the transactivation domain (p5313-52) or to a more global conformational change affecting both the DNA binding and the transactivation domains (p53R175H), failed to reduce <term>-catenin</term> levels. These findings support the view that the down-modulation of <term>-catenin</term> depends on the transcriptional activities of p53. For example, the decrease in <term>-catenin</term> might be mediated by the action of the products of one or several <term>p53</term> target genes whose expression is induced in cells exposed to high <term>levels</term> of activated p53. One interesting possibility is suggested by studies showing that APC mRNA is induced by excess <term>p53</term> in several cell types (59). Such induction of APC expression by <term>p53</term> may contribute to enhanced <term>-catenin</term> degradation in cells carrying a functional APC gene and may account for part of the observed reduction in <term>-catenin</term> protein following <term>p53</term> elevation. This observation cannot, however, explain the ability of <term>p53</term> to reduce <term>-catenin</term> expression in SW480 CRC cells, which harbor a <term>mutant</term> APC gene and are devoid of functional APC protein. Another potential contributor to the inhibitory effect of <term>p53</term> on <term>-catenin</term> is the Dickkopf protein, whose gene has recently been reported to be subject to transcriptional activation by <term>p53</term> (85). Dickkopf-1 blocks low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 6-mediated Wnt/-catenin signaling by directly interacting with LDL receptor-related protein 6 (49). In addition to transactivation, transcriptional repression by <term>p53</term> may also play a role in suppressing -catenin. One potential mediator of such an effect may be presenilin 1, whose expression is repressed by <term>p53</term> (69). Since presenilin 1 can stabilize <term>-catenin</term> (92), its down-regulation by <term>p53</term> might lead to destabilization of -catenin. It is conceivable that additional p53-regulated genes may also play a role in the down-regulation of <term>-catenin</term>  and <term>p53</term> might turn on a coordinated transcriptional program designed to inhibit -catenin-mediated signaling. While this paper was under revision, two studies were published suggesting that Siah-1, a transcriptional target of <term>p53</term>  can down-regulate -catenin. Liu et al. (47) and Matsuzawa and Reed (51) reported that a p53-inducible gene product(Siah-1) can mediate the down-regulation of <term>-catenin</term> by a novel degradation pathway mediated by SIP, Ebi, and the carboxy terminus of APC. This novel pathway may provide an additional means by which <term>p53</term> can inhibit the accumulation of <term>-catenin</term>  especially of the oncogenic <term>-catenin</term> mutants with <term>mutations</term> in the GSK phosphorylation sites, since this pathway operates independently of GSK3 (47). It is of note that whereas overexpression of Siah-1 in SW480 cells was unable to inhibit <term>-catenin</term> signaling (47), transfection of <term>p53</term> into these cells did cause a marked reduction in the level of nuclear <term>-catenin</term> and LEF-dependent transcription (Fig. 6). Taken together, these observations imply that <term>p53</term> can block <term>-catenin</term> signaling through multiple downstream effectors, with Siah-1 being just one of those. Minimally, the data argue that there are at least two major alternative pathways for p53-induced suppression of -catenin: a canonical cascade involving components of the Wnt pathway and a second mechanism involving Siah-1, SIP, and Ebi. Both pathways are probably turned on simultaneously when <term>p53</term> <term>levels</term> become sufficiently elevated, and they may synergize to achieve a more effective response. This could be particularly important when the target is an abundant protein such as -catenin. The relative contribution of each of the two pathways to the elimination of <term>-catenin</term> signaling probably varies with cell type and cell context and may be modulated by additional genetic alterations that occur in the course of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the existence of multiple parallel pathways for down-regulating <term>-catenin</term> by activated <term>p53</term> may provide a fail-safe mechanism in case one of the components along either of the pathways becomes inactivated. Alternatively, <term>p53</term> and <term>-catenin</term> may compete for a common interacting molecule required for <term>-catenin</term> stabilization. A possible candidate is the p300 (also called CBP) transcriptional coactivator, since both <term>p53</term> and <term>-catenin</term> can bind to p300 (6, 33, 79) and a recent study has shown that <term>p53</term> and <term>-catenin</term> compete for p300 binding (53). A similar competition for p300 binding between <term>p53</term> and NF-B, resulting in the inhibition of the transcriptional <term>activity</term> of each of these proteins by an excess of the other, has been described (86). Our preliminary results indicate that overexpression of p300 can protect <term>wt</term> <term>-catenin</term> from down-regulation by <term>p53</term> (data not shown). It is thus tempting to speculate that when p300 is present in limited amounts, increased <term>p53</term> <term>levels</term> can displace the endogenous <term>-catenin</term> from its complex with p300 and render it more susceptible to ubiquitination and degradation. A simple explanation that needs to be ruled out is that the reduction in <term>-catenin</term> protein is merely a consequence of p53-mediated apoptosis. Such a possibility may rely on previous observations that <term>-catenin</term> is subject to cleavage by caspases, mainly caspases 3, 6, and 8, in cells undergoing apoptosis (11, 81). We believe that this is an unlikely explanation for the effects of <term>p53</term> on <term>-catenin</term> for several reasons. First, no morphological changes suggestive of apoptosis were noted in any of the cell types used in this study when the cells were harvested for biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 1, 6, and 7 and data not shown). In addition, using the same antibody which was employed to demonstrate caspase-mediated <term>-catenin</term> cleavage (11, 81), we did not detect cleaved forms of <term>-catenin</term> in extracts of cells exposed to high <term>p53</term> <term>activity</term> (Fig. 1A, C, and E and 7E and data not shown). Hence, we suggest that the effect of <term>p53</term> on <term>-catenin</term> most probably is exerted through the pathway responsible for the normal proteasomal degradation of -catenin. A previous study has shown that excess deregulated <term>-catenin</term> can lead to the induction of active <term>p53</term> (15) and that this is also achieved through changes in the rate of proteasomal degradation of the affected protein  <term>p53</term> . In the present study, we demonstrate a reciprocal relationship between <term>p53</term> and <term>-catenin</term> in the same cell system by comparing the <term>levels</term> of the two proteins under conditions in which one protein was in excess over the other (Fig. 3D). It is clear from these results that increasing <term>levels</term> of <term>-catenin</term> augment the <term>levels</term> of <term>p53</term> when a constant amount of <term>p53</term> is cotransduced into the same cells. On the other hand, when high <term>levels</term> of <term>-catenin</term> are transfected, elevation of <term>p53</term> results in a specific, dose-dependent down-regulation of <term>-catenin</term> expression (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these studies delineate an autoregulatory loop in which excess <term>-catenin</term> induces <term>p53</term> activation, which in turn leads to down-regulation of <term>-catenin</term> <term>levels</term> and activity. This control loop might serve as an effective means for curbing the potential oncogenic effects of deregulated -catenin. Its disruption may unleash the oncogenic <term>activity</term> of <term>-catenin</term>  thereby contributing to tumor progression. The disruption of such autoregulation may occur through <term>mutations</term> in the <term>p53</term> gene that will render it unable to repress <term>-catenin</term> <term>activity</term> or by inactivation of the tumor suppressor ARF, which stabilizes <term>p53</term> (72). It is noteworthy that the ability to repress <term>-catenin</term> is lost in the p53R175H <term>mutant</term>  which is frequently seen in <term>human</term> CRC where <term>-catenin</term> is deregulated through the loss of functional APC (39, 60). This loop may also be disrupted by <term>mutations</term> in <term>-catenin</term> that render it resistant to the inhibitory effect of <term>p53</term>  as is the case with the S33Y <term>-catenin</term> mutant. In this regard, it is of interest that while <term>p53</term> <term>mutations</term> predominate in the major class of CRC (involving <term>-catenin</term> deregulation through APC gene inactivation), they are significantly less frequent in CRC carrying direct stabilizing <term>mutations</term> within <term>-catenin</term> itself (17, 44, 52, 75, 77). Moreover, in a recent study employing N-myc transgenic mice, the majority of liver tumors arising on a p53+/ background displayed either a <term>-catenin</term> mutation or a loss of the remaining <term>p53</term> allele (67). This further suggests that these two mutational events often tend to be mutually exclusive during tumorigenesis. Our findings offer an appealing explanation for these observations by predicting that early <term>mutations</term> in <term>-catenin</term> will render it refractory to down-regulation by <term>p53</term>  thereby significantly reducing the pressure for subsequent mutational inactivation of p53. Conversely, the predominance of <term>p53</term> <term>mutations</term> in the major class of CRC, which are associated with APC inactivation, suggests that the ability of <term>wt</term> <term>p53</term> to restrain the deregulated <term>wt</term> <term>-catenin</term> is a key component of its tumor suppressor function and a major cause for the elimination of <term>p53</term> function in such tumors.
