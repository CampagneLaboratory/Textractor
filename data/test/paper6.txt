      Abstract
      The classic cadherins are a group of calcium dependent, homophilic 
      cell-cell adhesion molecules that drive morphogenetic rearrangements and 
      maintain the integrity of cell groups through the formation of adherens 
      junctions. The formation and maintenance of cadherin-mediated adhesions is 
      a multistep process and mechanisms have evolved to regulate each step. 
      This suggests that functional state switching plays an important role in 
      development. Among the many challenges ahead is to determine the 
      developmental role that functional state switching plays in tissue 
      morphogenesis and to define the roles of each of the several regulatory 
      interactions that participate in switching. One correlate of the loss of 
      cadherin-mediated adhesion, the turn-off of cadherin function, is the 
      exit, or drop-out of cells from neural and epithelial layers and their 
      conversion to a motile phenotype. We suggest that epithelial mesenchymal 
      conversions may be initiated by signaling pathways that result in the loss 
      of cadherin function. Tyrosine phosphorylation of -catenin is one such 
      mechanism. Enhanced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on -catenin is 
      almost invariably associated with loss of the cadherin-actin connection 
      concomitant with loss of adhesive function. There are several tyrosine 
      kinases and phosphatases that have been shown to have the potential to 
      alter the phosphorylation state of -catenin and thus the function of 
      cadherins. Our laboratory has focused on the role of the nonreceptor 
      tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B in regulating the phosphorylation of -catenin 
      on tyrosine residues. Our data suggest that PTP1B is crucial for 
      maintenance of N-cadherin-mediated adhesions in embryonic neural retina 
      cells. By using an L-cell model system constitutively expressing 
      N-cadherin, we have worked out many of the molecular interactions 
      essential for this regulatory interaction. Extracellular cues that bias 
      this critical regulatory interaction toward increased phosphorylation of 
      -catenin may be a critical component of many developmental events. © 2002
