Here we show that presenilin-1  <term>PS1</term> , a protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease, controls a -secretase-like <term>cleavage</term> of E-cadherin. This <term>cleavage</term> is stimulated by apoptosis or calcium influx and occurs between human <term>E-cadherin</term> residues Leu731 and Arg732 at the membrane–cytoplasm interface. The <term>PS1/-secretase</term> system cleaves both the full-length <term>E-cadherin</term> and a transmembrane C-terminal fragment, derived from a metalloproteinase <term>cleavage</term> after the <term>E-cadherin</term> ectodomain residue Pro700. The <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> dissociates E-cadherins, <term>ß-catenin</term> and -catenin from the cytoskeleton, thus promoting disassembly of the E-cadherin–catenin <term>adhesion</term> complex. Furthermore, this <term>cleavage</term> releases the cytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term> to the cytosol and increases the levels of soluble ß- and -catenins. Thus, the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> system stimulates disassembly of the E-cadherin– catenin complex and increases the cytosolic pool of <term>ß-catenin</term>  a key regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway.

In addition, cadherins play important roles in cell signaling, proliferation and differentiation (Steinberg and McNutt, 1999; Tepass <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000). In cadherin-based adherens junctions (CAJs), the extracellular domains of transmembrane cadherins promote <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> by engaging in Ca2+-dependent homophilic interactions, while the cytoplasmic domains are linked to the actin cytoskeleton via - and ß-catenins (Steinberg and McNutt, 1999; Gumbiner, 2000). Post-translational regulation of cadherin adhesive activities, including proteolytic processing of cadherins and disassembly of CAJs, plays crucial roles in rapid changes in cell <term>adhesion</term>  signaling and apoptosis (Herren <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1998; Gumbiner, 2000; Vallorosi <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000; Steinhusen <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> , but the molecular mechanisms involved in cadherin processing and CAJ disassembly remain mostly unknown. <term>PS1</term> is a polytopic transmembrane protein involved in most cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD). Cellular <term>PS1</term> is cleaved to yield an N-terminal (PS1/NTF) and a C-terminal (PS1/CTF) fragment. Following <term>cleavage</term>  the resultant <term>PS1</term> fragments form a stable 1:1 heterodimer (Thinakaran <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1996; Podlisny <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1997) that binds to the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of <term>E-cadherin</term> (Baki <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> . <term>PS1</term> is found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi system and the neuronal somatodendritic compartment (Cook <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1996; Elder <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1996; Kovacs <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1996), but upon formation of <term>cell–cell</term> contacts <term>PS1</term> concentrates at intercellular sites at the cell surface where it forms complexes with the CAJ (Georgakopoulos <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999). In addition to <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>PS1</term> forms complexes with N-cadherin and it has been localized at synaptic sites (Georgakopoulos <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999). Recently it was reported that <term>PS1</term> regulates a <term>-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of both APP and Notch receptor and stimulates Aß production (De Strooper <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999; Selkoe, <term>2001</term> . Here we show that apoptosis or Ca2+ influx stimulates a <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of E-cadherin. This <term>cleavage</term> results in the release of the cytoplasmic sequence of <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>ß-catenin</term> and -catenin to the soluble cytosol, thus facilitating disassembly of CAJs. In contrast to APP and Notch, however, both of which are cleaved within their transmembrane sequence (Schroeter <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1998; Gu <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2001; Sastre <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2001; Yu <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> , the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> takes place at the membrane–cytosol interface.          Results       Top      Abstract      Introduction      Results      Discussion      Materials and methods      Acknowledgements      References A <term>PS1/-secretase</term> activity controls <term>E-cadherin</term> processingWe used extracts from <term>PS1</term> knock-out mouse embryos (PS1–/–) (Baki <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term>  to investigate whether <term>PS1</term> plays any role in <term>E-cadherin</term> processing. PS1–/– embryos had significantly higher amounts of a 38 kDa peptide that contained the cytoplasmic sequence of <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  than did wild-type (PS1+/+) embryos, even though <term>al.</term> embryos had similar levels of the full-length <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>Figure</term> 1A, upper panel). As expected (De Strooper <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999), PS1–/– embryos also contained increased levels of APP -stubs  <term>Figure</term> 1A, middle panels). <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> accumulates in a fibroblast cell line that was derived from PS1–/– mice (Baki <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term>  compared with a cell line from PS1+/+ mice, even though both cell lines express comparable amounts of transfected full-length <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>Figure</term> 1B). The accumulation of <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> in PS1–/– cells under conditions of constant levels of the full-length protein suggests that a PS1-mediated activity may control metabolism of E-Cad/CTF1. Indeed, treatment of E-cadherin-transfected PS1+/+ fibroblasts with the selective <term>-secretase</term> inhibitor L-685,458 (Li <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000; Shearman <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000) increased cellular <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> compared with non-treated controls  <term>Figure</term> 1C), indicating that the PS1-associated <term>-secretase</term> activity (Esler and Wolfe, <term>2001</term>  may be involved in the metabolism of E-Cad/CTF1.

(A) Extracts from PS1+/+ or PS1–/– mouse embryos were             probed on western blots with either anti-cytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term> C36             (upper panel) or anti-cytoplasmic APP R1 (middle panels) antibodies.

(B) Extracts from E-cadherin-transfected PS1+/+ or PS1–/–             mouse fibroblasts were probed with anti-E-cadherin C36 (upper panel)             or 33B10 (lower panel) antibodies. (C) PS1+/+ fibroblasts were             treated for 6 h either with the <term>-secretase</term> inhibitor L-685,458 (0.5             µM) or with dimethylsulfoxide. Extracts from these cell cultures             were then probed with anti-E-cadherin C36. The asterisk indicates a             non-specific band. Although our data suggested that peptide <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> is processed further by a PS1/-secretase-dependent <term>cleavage</term>  we were unable to detect any <term>E-cadherin</term> metabolites resulting from this activity either in embryos or in PS1+/+ fibroblasts. The apparent molecular weight and immunoreactivity of <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  however, suggested that this fragment derives from a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) <term>cleavage</term> of the <term>E-cadherin</term> ectodomain. Since this <term>cleavage</term> is stimulated by apoptosis (Steinhusen <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> , we asked whether the levels of the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> product of <term>E-cadherin</term> might increase in apoptotic conditions. Human epithelial cell line A431 that expresses high levels of endogenous <term>E-cadherin</term> and undergoes apoptosis under staurosporine (STS) treatment (Steinhusen <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term>  was used as a model. STS treatment of this cell line resulted in a time-dependent production of three <term>E-cadherin</term> C-terminal fragments migrating at 38, 33 and 29 kDa, respectively  <term>Figure</term> 2A). Production of the 38 kDa fragment is inhibited by the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (Galardy <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1994), indicating that this fragment, which has immunoreactivity and apparent molecular mass identical to <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  <term>Figure</term> 1), is derived from an MMP <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>Figure</term> 2B, middle panel, lanes 1 and 2). STS also increased a secreted 95 kDa fragment detected with <term>E-cadherin</term> ectodomain <term>antibody</term> H108  <term>Figure</term> 3). This fragment (termed E-Cad/NTF1, <term>Figure</term> 2C) does not react with antibodies against cytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term> (not shown) and, like <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  it is also inhibited by GM6001  <term>Figure</term> 2C), suggesting that E-Cad/NTF1 is the secreted counterpart of <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  <term>Figure</term> 3). The 29 kDa fragment (E-Cad/CTF3) is inhibited by the specific caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK  <term>Figure</term> 2B, middle panel, lanes 1 and 3), indicating that it is produced by an apoptosis-stimulated caspase-3 <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> (Steinhusen <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> .

The <term>-secretase</term> inhibitor L-685,458 completely blocked production of the 33 kDa cadherin fragment (E-Cad/CTF2; <term>Figure</term> 2B, middle panel, lanes 1, 4 and 5), indicating that this fragment is produced by a -secretase-like <term>cleavage</term> of E-cadherin.

Accordingly, overexpression of <term>PS1</term> in cell line HEK293 increased <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> and decreased <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  <term>Figure</term> 2D). That <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> is produced even when <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> is inhibited  <term>Figure</term> 2B, lane 2) suggests that the PS1/-secretase-dependent <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> can also be derived from full-length E-cadherin. In agreement with this suggestion, a 100 kDa <term>E-cadherin</term> fragment recognized by <term>antibody</term> H108 but not by anti-cytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>antibody</term> C36 (see <term>Figure</term> 3 for sequences recognized by these antibodies) was detected in cell extracts of GM6001-treated A431 cultures  <term>Figure</term> 2E), suggesting that this fragment (E-Cad/NTF2) is the N-terminal counterpart of <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> (see also <term>Figure</term> 3). In addition to A431, two other cell lines, SW480 and LNCaP, also produced the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> fragment <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> under Ca2+ influx conditions (data not shown), indicating that this is a general mechanism of <term>E-cadherin</term> processing. Identification of the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> and MMP <term>cleavage</term> sites of E-cadherinE-Cad/CTF1 and <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> were affinity purified from STS-treated A431 cells. Antibody H108 against <term>E-cadherin</term> sequence 600–707 (numbering according to the full-length unprocessed human <term>E-cadherin</term>  reacted with secreted E-Cad/NTF1  <term>Figure</term> 2C) but not with cellular <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> (not shown), suggesting that the MMP <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> occurs closer to the extracytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane than previously reported (Ito <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999). Indeed, Edman sequencing of <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> through 14 cycles showed the following major sequence: VEAGLQIPAILGIL. This is a unique sequence corresponding to human <term>E-cadherin</term> residues 701–714. The N-terminus of this sequence is located seven residues upstream of the transmembrane sequence of <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>Figure</term> 3). Mass spectrometry analysis of <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> showed no peptides upstream of the <term>cleavage</term> site that was determined by Edman sequencing (not shown). Thus, the 38 kDa <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> is produced by an MMP <term>cleavage</term> after <term>E-cadherin</term> residue Pro700  <term>Figure</term> 3). Edman sequencing of <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> yielded the following sequence: RRRAVVKEPLL. This is a unique sequence corresponding to human <term>E-cadherin</term> residues 732–742. Mass spectrometric analysis of <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> yielded <term>E-cadherin</term> peptides predicted from the sequencing data (not shown). These results show that the PS1-mediated <term>-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> takes place between residues Leu731 and Arg732 at the interface of the membrane with the cytoplasm  <term>Figure</term> 3). The -secretase-mediated <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> promotes disassembly of adherens junctionsThe molecular weight and immunoreactivity of the isolated peptides suggest that they contain the entire <term>E-cadherin</term> cytoplasmic sequence including the ß-catenin-binding site (Steinberg and McNutt, 1999). Co- immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the MMP <term>cleavage</term> product <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> binds both <term>ß-catenin</term> and <term>PS1</term>  whereas the <term>-secretase</term> product <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> binds only <term>ß-catenin</term>  <term>Figure</term> 4A). Thus, the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> dissociates <term>PS1</term> from the E-cadherin–ß-catenin complex.

Released <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> dissociates from <term>PS1</term> but remains bound             to ß-catenin. (A) Extracts from STS-treated A431 cells were             immunoprecipitated with antibodies against <term>PS1</term> (I-R222), pre-immune             serum (PI-R222), <term>ß-catenin</term> or desmoglein, and the immunoprecipitates             (IPs) obtained were probed on western blots with anti-E-cadherin             <term>antibody</term> C36. For reference, cell lysate was also probed; the             asterisk shows IgGs. (B) A431 cells treated for 6 h with STS were             fractionated into membrane, soluble cytosolic and Triton             X-100-insoluble (TX100- insoluble) fractions, and the fractions             obtained were then probed on western blots with C36 antibody. Subcellular fractionation of STS-treated A431 cells showed that full-length <term>E-cadherin</term> and <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> are found only in the membrane and cytoskeletal (Triton X-100-insoluble) fractions while <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> localizes in the membrane and in the soluble cytosol  <term>Figure</term> 4B), suggesting that the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> results in the solubilization of the cytoplasmic sequence of E-cadherin. In stable <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term>  the E-cadherin– <term>ß-catenin</term> complex of the CAJ is anchored to the actin cytoskeleton via -catenin, and this association is manifested by the insolubility of the complex components in Triton X-100 (Nathke <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1994; Baki <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> .

To determine whether the <term>-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> is involved in the CAJ disassembly, we induced calcium influx with ionomycin in A431 cells in the absence or presence of the <term>-secretase</term> inhibitor L-685,458. In the absence of this inhibitor, ionomycin induced a time-dependent decrease in the cytoskeletal (Triton X-100-insoluble) fraction of both full-length <term>E-cadherin</term> and <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  <term>Figure</term> 5A, left panel), and this decrease correlated with a corresponding increase in soluble cytosolic <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term>  <term>Figure</term> 5A, right panel). Similarly, ionomycin decreased the cytoskeletal association (Triton X-100-insoluble fraction) of the CAJ components ß- and -catenin with a concomitant significant increase in their soluble cytosolic levels  <term>Figure</term> 5B). These data indicate that ionomycin induces a time-dependent disassembly of the E-cadherin–catenin cytoskeletal complex resulting in increased production of the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> fragment <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> and in the solubilization of cytoskeletal ß- and -catenins.

Following the             ionomycin-induced <term>cell–cell</term> dissociation, the distribution of <term>PS1</term>              <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>ß-catenin</term> and -catenin in <term>al.</term> cultures was analyzed by             LSCM using the constant detector setting. Cells were double labeled             either with anti-PS1/NTF <term>antibody</term> R222 (A–C) and anti-cytoplasmic             <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>antibody</term> C36 (D–F), or with anti-ectodomain <term>E-cadherin</term>             <term>antibody</term> H108 (G–I) and anti-ß-catenin <term>antibody</term> (J–L). Cells were             also labeled for -catenin (M–O). Arrows indicate a cell population             showing <term>ß-catenin</term> immunoreactivity at the cell surface without             ectodomain <term>E-cadherin</term> labeling (I and L). Scale bar = 30 µm. Pre-incubation with L-685,458 significantly delayed loss of cell surface staining of <term>al.</term> epitopes  <term>Figure</term> 6, right panels). Ectodomain <term>E-cadherin</term> staining was also partially preserved at the cell surface and at <term>cell–cell</term> contacts  <term>Figure</term> 6G–I), in agreement with our finding that L-685,458 inhibits the ionomycin-induced metabolism of cytoskeletal full-length <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>Figure</term> 5A). However, two-color immunofluorescence of L-685,458-treated cells revealed a cell population containing <term>ß-catenin</term> but no ectodomain <term>E-cadherin</term> at the cell surface (arrows in <term>Figure</term> 6I and L), suggesting that these represent junctional complexes of <term>ß-catenin</term> with <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> (see also <term>Figure</term> 4A). In L-685,458-treated cultures, there was a complete junctional overlap between staining of cytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term> and <term>PS1</term>  <term>Figure</term> 6C and F), suggesting that cell surface <term>PS1</term> remains bound to both full-length <term>E-cadherin</term> and E-Cad/CTF1. This observation concurs with our biochemical data showing that <term>PS1</term> binds both full-length <term>E-cadherin</term> and <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  <term>Figure</term> 4A).

In contrast to wild-type protein, mutant <term>E-cadherin</term> failed to bind <term>PS1</term>  <term>Figure</term> 7A), consistent with reports that the <term>E-cadherin</term> sequence 760–771 (corresponding to residues 604–615 of mature processed <term>E-cadherin</term>  is necessary for PS1–E-cadherin binding (Baki <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> .

Discussion       Top      Abstract      Introduction      Results      Discussion      Materials and methods      Acknowledgements      References Disassembly of CAJs and abrogation of cadherin-mediated <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> is involved in changes of cell state including differentiation, apoptosis and tumor metastasis. For example, induction of apoptotic cell death or Ca2+ imbalance involves <term>cleavage</term> of cadherins and disassembly of CAJs (Herren <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1998; Ito <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999; Vallorosi <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000; Steinhusen <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> . Furthermore, in the case of metastasis of epithelia tumors, inhibition of E-cadherin-mediated <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> is promoted by <term>cleavage</term> and secretion of extracytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term> by MMPs (Lochter <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1997; Christofori and Semb, 1999; Noe <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> . Although in some cell cultures <term>PS1</term> was found mainly in the ER–Golgi system (De Strooper <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1997; Cupers <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> , in cell cultures with exten sive <term>cell–cell</term> contacts and in tissues <term>PS1</term> concentrates mainly at the plasma membrane (Georgakopoulos <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999; Nowotny <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000; Xia <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term>  and, in the brain, this protein concentrates at synaptic contacts (Georgakopoulos <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999; Ribaut-Barassin <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000). In addition, <term>PS1</term> has been detected in vesicles (Efthimiopoulos <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1998) and at the surface of both Drosophila cells (Nowotny <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000) and adhesive lamellipodia (Schwarzman <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999). The plasma membrane localization of <term>PS1</term> is entirely consistent with its role in the processing of cell surface transmembrane proteins including APP, Notch1 receptor and E-cadherin. Our data define a novel mechanism of CAJ disassembly  <term>Figure</term> 7C). Key steps in this mechanism are the proteolytic <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> by a <term>PS1/-secretase</term> activity at the membrane–cytoplasm interface and a novel MMP <term>cleavage</term> of extracellular <term>E-cadherin</term> that occurs close to the plasma membrane. <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term>  the product of the MMP <term>cleavage</term>  remains bound to catenins and anchored to the cytoskeleton  <term>Figure</term> 7C). The <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> dissociates both <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> and full-length <term>E-cadherin</term> from the cytoskeleton and promotes solubilization of cytoskeletal ß- and -catenin, thus promoting disassembly of the CAJs. That the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>cleavage</term> is significantly increased upon cell apoptosis or Ca2+ imbalance suggests the existence of signaling mechanisms that regulate the activity of the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> proteolytic system. It was shown recently that under conditions that favor <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term>  <term>PS1</term> stabilizes the E-cadherin–catenin <term>adhesion</term> complex (Baki <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> . Combined with the present data, this suggests that with regard to the formation and disassembly of CAJs, <term>PS1</term> may have two distinct activities. (i) Under conditions promoting <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term>  incorporation of <term>PS1</term> into the E-cadherin–catenin complex results in the stabilization of <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> (Baki <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> . (ii) In contrast, under conditions of <term>cell–cell</term> dissociation or apoptosis, <term>PS1</term> promotes disassembly of adherens junctions, thus facilitating cell separation. Having both activities in the same polypeptide may represent an efficient and quick way for the formation and dissolution of <term>cell–cell</term> contacts. Interestingly p120ctn, a protein that like <term>PS1</term> binds the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of <term>E-cadherin</term>  has also been shown to have either positive or negative effects on CAJ-mediated <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> (Thoreson <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000). Induction of the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> results in the release of the E-Cad/CTF2–ß-catenin complex from the cytoskeleton and in a significant increase in the soluble cytosolic <term>ß-catenin</term>  <term>Figure</term> 5C). Free cytosolic <term>ß-catenin</term> is a key potent regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. It translocates to the nucleus where it complexes with Lef-1/Tcf transcription factors to activate expression of target genes (Polakis, 2000). Thus, production of the E-Cad/CTF2–ß-catenin complex, rather than free <term>ß-catenin</term>  may provide a large pool of complexed inactive <term>ß-catenin</term> from where it could be released according to the transcriptional needs of the cell. The potential importance of <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> in signal transduction is indicated in recent studies using artificial constructs overexpressing soluble cytoplasmic cadherin sequences. These constructs bind <term>ß-catenin</term> and inhibit the ß-catenin/Lef-1/Tcf signaling events (Sadot <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1998; Gottardi <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> . In addition, by sequestering <term>ß-catenin</term>  these constructs act as dominant-negative agents in cell growth and development (Sanson <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1996; Gottardi <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> . Thus the PS1/-secretase-derived <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term> may provide a cellular regulatory link between changes in the E-cadherin-based <term>cell–cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> and the Wnt signal transduction pathway. That PS1–/– mouse embryos accumulate <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> indicates that <term>PS1/-secretase</term> processing of E-cadherins occurs early in development and may control cadherin-mediated developmental processes and cell fate decisions. The <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> shows several important differences from the corresponding cleavages in APP and Notch. Recent data (Gu <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2001; Sastre <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2001; Yu <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term>  suggest that the APP <term>cleavage</term> may not occur in the middle of the transmembrane sequence of APP that defines the C- terminus of Aß peptides, but rather closer to the cytoplasm about three residues inside the membrane. Our data show that the <term>-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> takes place at the end of the transmembrane sequence probably outside the lipid bilayer at the membrane–cytoplasm interface, suggesting that an intramembranous <term>cleavage</term> may not be a requirement for the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> proteolytic system. Similarly to APP and Notch, <term>-secretase</term> cleaves a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment of <term>E-cadherin</term> resulting from an ectodomain cleavage. In contrast to full-length APP and Notch, however, which do not seem to be cleaved by <term>-secretase</term>  full-length <term>E-cadherin</term> may also be processed by this activity. Finally, our data suggest that <term>E-cadherin</term> mutants unable to bind <term>PS1</term> are not cleaved by the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> system. It would be important to determine whether <term>PS1</term> binding to APP or Notch is a requirement for the <term>-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of these proteins. Our findings have important implications for Alzheimer’s disease because they raise the possibility that the <term>PS1</term> FAD mutants affect the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> of several CAJ systems. We observed that in addition to <term>E-cadherin</term>  two more classic cadherins, N- and VE-cadherins, both of which display high homology to <term>E-cadherin</term>  are metabolized by the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> system (unpublished observations). Both E- and N-cadherins have been found at the synapse and are reported to play key roles in synaptic structure and function (Fannon and Colman, 1996; Tang <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1998; Tanaka <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  2000). In addition, VE-cadherin plays important roles in endothelial permeability (Sandoval <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  <term>2001</term> , vascular integrity (Corada <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999) and survival signaling of endothelial tissue (Carmeliet <term>et</term> <term>al.</term>  1999). It will be important to examine what roles, if any, the <term>PS1/-secretase</term> <term>cleavage</term> plays in the functions of the above cadherin systems. Furthermore, it will be important to determine any potential effects of the <term>PS1</term> FAD mutants on the <term>-secretase</term> processing of classic cadherins and their functions. However, our data suggest that potential therapeutic treatments targeting <term>-secretase</term> may also affect the proteolytic processing and/or function of a number of cadherin adhesion/signaling systems.

The supernatant was then centrifuged at 120 000 g for 45 min at 4°C to separate the cytosolic and crude membrane fractions. The pellet (crude membrane fraction) was washed twice with buffer A and resuspended by sonication in 400 µl of buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. The suspension was incubated at 4°C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 120 000 g for 45 min at 4°C to separate the membrane and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. The pellet (Triton X-100-insoluble fraction) was washed twice with buffer A and solubilized by sonication in RIPA buffer. A 20 µg aliquot of proteins from the different fractions was analyzed by SDS–PAGE. Immunoprecipitations (IPs), immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopyFor western blot analysis of cell extracts, cells were washed with PBS and then solubilized in RIPA buffer. For IPs, cells were solubilized in HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1x Complete protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) containing 1% digitonin (IPs with I-R222 and PI-R222 antibodies) or 1% Triton X-100 (IPs with <term>ß-catenin</term> and desmoglein antibodies). Following centrifugation at 17 000 g for 10 min, supernatants (1 mg of protein) were pre-cleared with protein A– or protein G–agarose (Pierce) for 2 h. Supernatants were then incubated with antibodies overnight at 4°C and treated for 2 h with protein A– agarose (polyclonal antibodies) or with protein G–agarose (monoclonal antibodies).

Following washing in TBS (25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl), cells were treated with 10% goat serum in SuperBlock (Pierce) for 1 h, incubated overnight with primary <term>antibody</term> (1:100), washed in TBS and then incubated with species-specific Alexa FluorTM secondary <term>antibody</term> conjugates (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed with TBS, mounted with Prolong antifade kit (Molecular Probes) and photographed on a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope. Purification, mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequence analysis of <term>E-cadherin</term> C-terminal fragmentsA431 cells treated with 1 µM STS for 6 h were solubilized by sonication in RIPA buffer. A 50 mg aliquot of protein extract was pre-cleared with 20 µg of H108 <term>antibody</term>  20 µg of unrelated monoclonal <term>antibody</term> and a mixture of protein A– and protein G–agarose (Pierce). The pre-cleared supernatant was treated overnight with 120 µg of C36 anti-E-cadherin <term>antibody</term>  and immunoglobulins were precipitated with 500 µl of protein G–agarose. Immunoprecipitates were split into two samples and submitted to SDS–PAGE. One sample was stained with GelCode blue stain reagent (Pierce) and the 33 and 38 kDa fragments of <term>E-cadherin</term> were submitted to MALDI-MS Peptide Mass Mapping after in-gel digestion (Dr M.A.Gawinowicz, HHMI/Columbia University Protein Core Facility). The second sample was transferred on to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and the 38 and 33 kDa bands corresponding to <term>E-Cad/CTF1</term> and <term>E-Cad/CTF2</term>  respectively, were subjected to sequential derivitization and <term>cleavage</term> of N-terminal amino acids by Edman chemistry followed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, (automated Applied Biosystems Procise 492 Peptide Sequencer, New York University Protein Analysis Facility).
