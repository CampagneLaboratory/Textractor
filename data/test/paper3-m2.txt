      Discussion References Here we show that presenilin-1 ( term PS1 term ), a protein involved in Alzheimer's 
disease,  term binds term  directly to epithelial cadherin ( term E-cadherin term ). This 
 term binding term  is mediated by the large cytoplasmic loop of  term PS1 term  and requires 
the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic  term sequence term  604-615 of mature 
 term E-cadherin term . This  term sequence term  is also required for  term E-cadherin term   term binding term  of 
protein  term p120 term , a known regulator of cadherin-mediated cell  term adhesion term . 
Using wild-type and  term PS1 term  knockout cells, we found that increasing  term PS1 term  
levels suppresses  term p120 term / term E-cadherin term   term binding term , and increasing  term p120 term  levels 
suppresses  term PS1 term / term E-cadherin term   term binding term . Thus  term PS1 term  and  term p120 term  bind to and 
mutually compete for cellular  term E-cadherin term . Furthermore,  term PS1 term  stimulates 
 term E-cadherin term   term binding term  to beta- and gamma-catenin, promotes cytoskeletal association of the 
 term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term es, and increases Ca2+-dependent 
 term cell-cell term  aggregation. Remarkably,  term PS1 term  familial Alzheimer disease 
mutant DeltaE9 
increased neither the levels of  term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term es nor cell 
aggregation, suggesting that this familial Alzheimer disease mutation 
interferes with cadherin-based  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term . These data 
identify  term PS1 term  as an  term E-cadherin term - term binding term  protein and a regulator of 
 term E-cadherin term  function in vivo.                Introduction        Top Abstract Introduction Materials and

      Discussion References Presenilin-1 ( term PS1 term ) mutations are responsible for most cases of early-onset 
familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).  term PS1 term  is a transmembrane protein 
expressed in many tissues, including brain, where it is enriched in 
neurons (1, 2).  term PS1 term  crosses the 
membrane eight times, with the N terminus, the C terminus, and the 
large hydrophilic loop all located in the cytoplasm. Most cellular 
 term PS1 term  is cleaved within the large cytoplasmic loop to yield N-terminal 
fragments ( term PS1 term /NTF) of approximately 30 kDa and C-terminal 
fragments ( term PS1 term /CTF) of approximately 20 kDa. After cleavage, the 
 term PS1 term  fragments form stable 1:1 heterodimers (3, 4).  term PS1 term  facilitates 
processing of Notch-1 receptor, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
(5, 
6) 
stimulates production of Abeta peptide (6) and may 
play a role in neuroprotection (7, 8). Mice lacking 
 term PS1 term  ( term PS1 term -/-) die shortly after birth 
with skeletal malformations, impaired neurogenesis, and brain 
hemorrhage (7). 
Recently, we reported that  term PS1 term  concentrates at synaptic and epithelial 
 term cell-cell term  contact sites, where it forms  term complex term es with the 
 term cadherin/catenin term   term adhesion term  system (9). Classic 
cadherins, including  term E-cadherin term  and neuronal cadherin (N-cadherin), 
are a family of type I transmembrane proteins that mediate 
Ca2+-dependent  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term  and recognition, and control 
critical events in neurogenesis, tissue development, and tissue 
homeostasis (10, 11). These 
functions are mediated by homophilic interactions of the 
extracellular region of cadherins. The membrane-distal cytoplasmic 
 term sequence term  of cadherins  term binds term  either beta-catenin or gamma-catenin (plakoglobin), which in turn  term binds term  alpha-catenin. The latter 
protein  term binds term  polymerized actin, thus linking the  term cadherin/catenin term  
 term adhesion term   term complex term  to the cortical cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal linkage 
of the  term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term es is crucial for the full 
expression of the adhesive functions of surface cadherins (12-14). beta-Catenin and 
gamma-catenin, two 
highly homologous members of the armadillo family of proteins (for a 
review see ref. 15), bind the 
same  term sequence term  of cytoplasmic cadherin in a mutually exclusive 
manner (16, 17). The 
juxtamembrane (membrane-proximal) region of cytoplasmic cadherins 
 term binds term   term p120 term  (also called  term p120 term ctn), a cytosolic protein originally 
identified as a target for p60v-src kinase and later shown to 
regulate cadherin-mediated  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term  and tumor metastasis 
(for a review see ref. 18). Although  term PS1 term   term binds term  to the  term cadherin/catenin term   term adhesion term   term complex term  (9), the mechanism 
and functional con term sequence term s of this association remain obscure. Here 
we show that  term PS1 term   term binds term  directly to juxtamembrane cytoplasmic cadherin 
and inhibits cadherin  term binding term  of  term p120 term . Furthermore,  term PS1 term  stabilizes 
the  term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term , promotes its cytoskeletal association, 
and stimulates Ca2+-dependent  term cell-cell term  aggregation. In contrast,  term PS1 term  
FAD mutant DeltaE9 failed to stabilize the  term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term  and did 
not stimulate  term cell-cell term  aggregation.                Materials and Methods        Top Abstract Introduction Materials

(9), and L cells 
were from the American Type Culture Collection. Stable transfections 
of  term E-cadherin term  cDNAs cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) were 
performed as described (2, 9). Transient

the presence or absence of 2 mM Ca2+. The degree of aggregation 
and size of aggregates was documented by photography.  term IPs term  were 
performed as described (9) and

      References  term PS1 term / term E-cadherin term  Binding Is Independent of Catenins.  term PS1 term  is a 
component of the  term E-cadherin term /beta-catenin  term adhesion term   term complex term  (9). Examination of 
 term E-cadherin term , gamma-catenin, and  term PS1 term   term IPs term  prepared from confluent 
Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cultures (9) revealed that 
 term PS1 term  is also a component of the  term E-cadherin term /gamma-catenin  term complex term  (Fig. 1A). Because 
 term PS1 term   term binds term  beta-catenin 
(19, 20), we 
attempted to determine whether  term PS1 term   term binds term   term E-cadherin term  independent 
of catenins.  term Triton term  X-100 extracted most of  term PS1 term /CTF from a beta-catenin IP 
but failed to extract any  term PS1 term /CTF from an  term E-cadherin term  IP, indicating 
that the  term PS1 term / term E-cadherin term   term binding term  might be distinct from the  term PS1 term /beta-catenin 
 term binding term  (Fig. 1B, 
Lower). To further test this hypothesis, we prepared  term PS1 term   term IPs term  
from L cells transfected with either full-length  term E-cadherin term  (EL 
cells) or with  term E-cadherin term  deletion construct EDeltaC71 that lacks the last 
(membrane-distal) 71 cytoplasmic amino acids that bind beta- and gamma-catenin (EDeltaC71L cells; see Fig. 2A). 
Untransfected L cells contain no detectable  term E-cadherin term  (21), and  term PS1 term   term IPs term  
from these cells did not react with anti- term E-cadherin term  antibodies 
(Fig. 2B, lanes 
1 and 5). In  term E-cadherin term -transfected cells, however,  term PS1 term  formed 
 term complex term es with both full-length and EDeltaC71 cadherins (Fig. 2B, lanes 
2 and 3 and 6 and 7). Because construct EDeltaC71 lacks the 
catenin- term binding term   term sequence term  and  term binds term  neither beta- nor gamma-catenin (data not shown; 
see also refs. 14 and 22), our data 
show that  term PS1 term  associates with  term E-cadherin term  even when catenins are 
not bound to  term E-cadherin term . Chemical crosslinking is used to 
analyze direct protein-protein contacts within protein  term complex term es, 
including the  term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term  (22, 23).  term PS1 term   term IPs term  
prepared from crosslinked EL or EDeltaC71L cells contained 
 term E-cadherin term -reactive, SDS-resistant  term complex term es of approximate apparent 
molecular mass 170 kDa and 160 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2C). The 
apparent molecular mass of the crosslinked products is in excellent 
agreement with the predicted molecular mass of a ternary  term complex term  
containing one molecule each of  term PS1 term /CTF,  term PS1 term /NTF, and full length or 
truncated  term E-cadherin term , respectively. These  term complex term es were 
immunoprecipitated with anti- term PS1 term /NTF antibody R222 and reacted with 
anti- term PS1 term /CTF antibody 33B10, verifying that they contain both  term PS1 term  
fragments (Fig. 2C). These 
data show that  term PS1 term   term binds term  directly to  term E-cadherin term  at a  term sequence term  
distinct from the catenin- term binding term  site and suggest that the two 
proteins combine in a 1:1 ratio.                                         View larger version

            antibody (E-cad IP), and the resulting  term IPs term  were probed on WBs with

             term PS1 term /CTF Mediates  term PS1 term  Binding to Juxtamembrane Cytoplasmic 
 term E-cadherin term .  term Triton term  X-100 treatment of a digitonin  term E-cadherin term  IP extracted 
the  term PS1 term /NTF but not the  term PS1 term /CTF, which remained associated with 
 term E-cadherin term  (Fig. 1B). This 
result suggests that  term PS1 term   term binding term  to  term E-cadherin term  may be mediated by 
peptide  term PS1 term /CTF and is in agreement with recent data that the  term binding term  
between  term PS1 term /NTF and  term PS1 term /CTF is sensitive to  term Triton term  X-100 extraction 
(20). Together 
with the chemical crosslinking data (see above), these results 
suggest that  term PS1 term /CTF, which contains  term PS1 term   term sequence term  299-467 (3), mediates 
the  term PS1 term / term E-cadherin term   term binding term . In vitro blot overlay assays 
showed that  term PS1 term   term sequence term  256-410, which includes the entire large 
cytoplasmic loop,  term binds term  to the cytoplasmic  term sequence term  of  term E-cadherin term  
(data not shown). Fig. 2D shows 
that, whereas full-length  term PS1 term /CTF bound  term E-cadherin term  in vivo, a 
 term PS1 term /CTF construct lacking  term sequence term  340-375 did not. In contrast, 
 term PS1 term /CTF construct lacking  term sequence term  299-330 bound  term E-cadherin term  (data not 
shown). Combined, these results show that  term PS1 term   term sequence term  340-375 of the 
large cytoplasmic loop is required for  term PS1 term   term binding term  to cytoplasmic 
 term E-cadherin term . The observation that  term PS1 term   term binds term   term E-cadherin term  lacking the last 
71 cytoplasmic residues, combined with in vitro experiments 
showing that the  term PS1 term   term sequence term   term binds term  cytoplasmic  term E-cadherin term , 
suggested that  term PS1 term   term binds term  within the remaining membrane proximal 
80 residues of cytoplasmic  term E-cadherin term  (Fig. 2A). Because 
these residues also mediate  term E-cadherin term   term binding term  of protein  term p120 term , a 
regulator of cadherin-mediated cell  term adhesion term  (21, 24), we asked 
whether there is an overlap between the  term E-cadherin term   term sequence term s that 
mediate  term binding term  of both proteins. Indeed, deletion of  term E-cadherin term  
cytoplasmic  term sequence term  604-615, which is required for  term p120 term   term binding term  to 
 term E-cadherin term  (Fig. 2B, lanes 
4 and 12; and ref. 21), also 
abolished  term E-cadherin term - term PS1 term   term binding term  (Fig. 2B, lanes 
4 and 8), showing that this  term sequence term  is critical for  term E-cadherin term  
 term binding term  of both  term PS1 term  and  term p120 term . 
 term PS1 term  Competes with  term p120 term  for  term E-cadherin term  Binding in 
Vivo. That the same  term E-cadherin term   term sequence term  is required for  term binding term  of both 
 term PS1 term  and  term p120 term  suggests that these proteins might compete for 
 term E-cadherin term   term binding term . Indeed,  term E-cadherin term   term IPs term  prepared from  term PS1 term -/- mouse embryos contained 
significantly more  term p120 term  than  term E-cadherin term   term IPs term  from  term PS1 term +/+ embryos (Fig. 
3A). To 
further explore this phenomenon, we used fibroblast cells derived 
from  term PS1 term -/- and  term PS1 term +/+ mice. Because 
these cells express undetectable levels of endogenous  term E-cadherin term , we 
transfected both of them and selected lines expressing similar levels

expected, transfected  term E-cadherin term  coimmunoprecipitated with peptide 
 term PS1 term /CTF in  term PS1 term +/+ cells but not in  term PS1 term -/- cells (Fig. 3C; see also 
Fig. 5A, 
Right, for the reverse experiment).  term E-cadherin term   term IPs term  prepared 
from  term PS1 term -/- cells contained significantly 
higher levels of  term p120 term  than did  term E-cadherin term   term IPs term  from  term PS1 term +/+ cells (Fig. 
3D, 
Left), even though the two cell lines contain similar levels 
of cellular  term p120 term  (Fig. 3D, Lower 
Right). In the reverse experiments,  term p120 term   term IPs term  from  term PS1 term -/- cells contained more  term E-cadherin term  
than did  term p120 term   term IPs term  from  term PS1 term +/+ cells (Fig. 3D, Upper 
Right). Reintroduction of  term PS1 term  into  term PS1 term -/- cells by transfection reduced the 
 term E-cadherin term / term p120 term   term complex term  (Fig. 3E Left and 
Middle) and induced the appearance of the  term E-cadherin term / term PS1 term  
 term complex term  (Fig. 3E Right). 
These data show that  term PS1 term  inhibits  term p120 term   term binding term  to  term E-cadherin term . 
Conversely, overexpression of  term p120 term  in EL cells decreased the 
 term E-cadherin term / term PS1 term   term complex term  while it increased the  term E-cadherin term / term p120 term   term complex term  
(Fig. 3F, 
Lower and Upper, respectively). Thus,  term p120 term  is also 
capable of inhibiting  term PS1 term   term binding term  to  term E-cadherin term . In summary, our data 
show that  term PS1 term   term binds term   term E-cadherin term  and promotes the dissociation of the 
 term E-cadherin term / term p120 term   term complex term . The reverse is also true;  term p120 term   term binds term  
 term E-cadherin term  and promotes the dissociation of the  term E-cadherin term / term PS1 term  
 term complex term . Taken together, our results indicate that the two proteins 
compete for  term E-cadherin term   term binding term  in vivo.                                         View larger version

Cadherin/Catenin Complex and Stimulates Ca2+-Dependent Cell-Cell 
Aggregation. Recent reports suggest that  term PS1 term  regulates  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term , 
but the molecular basis of this regulation remains unknown (9). That 
 term PS1 term  competes with  term p120 term  for  term E-cadherin term   term binding term  suggests that  term PS1 term  may 
function as an additional regulator of the cadherin-based  term adhesion term  
system. Indeed, in the presence of Ca2+,  term E-cadherin term -transfected 
 term PS1 term -/- cells aggregated poorly 
compared with  term E-cadherin term -transfected  term PS1 term +/+ cells, suggesting that 
 term PS1 term  stimulates Ca2+-dependent  term cell-cell term  aggregation (Fig.

Untransfected  term PS1 term +/+ cells expressing undetectable levels of 
 term E-cadherin term  showed little aggregation compared with 
 term E-cadherin term -transfected  term PS1 term +/+ cells (Fig. 4A), 
indicating that aggregation is  term E-cadherin term -mediated. Reintroduction of 
WT  term PS1 term  into  term PS1 term -/- cells substantially 
increased Ca2+-dependent  term cell-cell term  aggregation (Fig. 4B). In 
contrast to WT  term PS1 term  that was able to restore cadherin-dependent 
aggregation,  term PS1 term  mutant DeltaE9 was inactive (Fig. 4B).                                         View larger version

            analyzed for expression of the transfected  term PS1 term  proteins. To further explore the possible mechanism by which  term PS1 term  stimulates 
 term cell-cell term   term adhesion term , we determined the  term PS1 term  effects on the stability of 
the  term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term es with the use of  term E-cadherin term -transfected 
 term PS1 term -/- and  term PS1 term +/+ fibroblasts expressing 
similar levels of exogenous  term E-cadherin term  (see above).  term E-cadherin term   term IPs term  
prepared from confluent  term PS1 term +/+ cells contained significantly higher 
levels of gamma-, beta-, and alpha-catenin than 
 term E-cadherin term   term IPs term  from  term PS1 term -/- cells 
(Fig. 5A). 
In the reverse experiments gamma-, beta-,

from  term PS1 term  +/+ cells contained higher levels of  term E-cadherin term  than the 
corresponding  term IPs term  from  term PS1 term -/- cells 
(Fig. 5B).  term PS1 term  had 
a more dramatic effect on the  term E-cadherin term /gamma-catenin association than on the 
 term E-cadherin term /beta-catenin association (Fig. 5 A and 
B). Reintroduction of WT  term PS1 term  in  term PS1 term -/- cells increased the 
 term E-cadherin term   term complex term es not only with  term PS1 term  (Fig. 3E, 
Right), but also with both beta- and gamma-catenin (Fig. 5 C and 
D, respectively). Interestingly, in contrast to WT  term PS1 term , FAD 
mutant DeltaE9 failed to stimulate  term binding term  of gamma-catenin to  term E-cadherin term  (Fig.

and was less effective than the WT  term PS1 term  in stimulating the 
 term E-cadherin term /beta-catenin  term complex term  (Fig. 5C). 
Together with the data from the aggregation experiments, these 
results suggest that WT  term PS1 term , but not  term PS1 term  mutant DeltaE9, stimulates

Complex. Stable cadherin-dependent  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term  in intact cells 
requires linkage of the cadherin/beta- and gamma-catenin  term complex term es to the actin cytoskeleton (12, 13, 23). This linkage 
is mediated by alpha-catenin (25) and is 
manifested by an increased insolubility of the  term cadherin/catenin term

Examination of  term E-cadherin term  and alpha-catenin  term IPs term  prepared from

fibroblasts showed that the former cells contained higher levels of 
the  term E-cadherin term /alpha-catenin  term complex term es than the latter cells (Fig. 5 A and

cytoskeletal association of the  term cadherin/catenin term   term adhesion term   term complex term es. 
Indeed, Fig. 6A shows 
that in  term PS1 term +/+ cells a significantly higher fraction of total gamma-catenin was found in 
the  term Triton term  X-100-insoluble fraction compared with  term PS1 term -/- cells, where almost all of the gamma-catenin was 
found in the  term Triton term  X-100-soluble fraction.  term E-cadherin term  also showed an 
increased distribution in the  term Triton term  X-100-insoluble fraction in 
 term PS1 term +/+ cells compared with  term PS1 term -/- cells, 
suggesting an increased cytoskeletal association (Fig. 6A). Similar 
results were obtained for beta-catenin (data not shown).  term PS1 term  
transfection of  term PS1 term -/- cells 
stimulated the cytoskeletal association of  term E-cadherin term , beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, whereas

      Discussion References Cadherin-based  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term  and communication are critical determinants 
of tissue development, function, and homeostasis (10, 11). The present 
study shows that  term PS1 term   term binds term  directly to  term E-cadherin term . Remarkably, this 
 term binding term  requires mature  term E-cadherin term  amino acids 604-615, which are 
also required for  term E-cadherin term   term binding term  of  term p120 term , a regulator of 
cadherin-mediated  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term  (21, 24).  term PS1 term  displaces 
 term p120 term  from  term E-cadherin term , stabilizes the  term binding term  of beta- and gamma-catenins to  term E-cadherin term , increases 
linkage of the  term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term  to the cytoskeleton, and 
stimulates Ca2+- and cadherin-dependent  term cell-cell term  aggregation. These 
findings show that  term PS1 term  regulates the molecular composition and 
function of the cadherin-based  term adhesion term  system and suggest a possible 
mechanism for  term PS1 term -induced stabilization of the  term cadherin/catenin term  
 term complex term  (Fig. 7).  term PS1 term /CTF 
 term sequence term  340-375  term binds term   term E-cadherin term   term sequence term  604-615 and may tether the 
membrane-proximal cytoplasmic  term E-cadherin term  close to the plasma 
membrane. At a more distal site on  term E-cadherin term  are bound beta- or gamma-catenin (16, 17), which in turn 
may bind  term PS1 term  (19, 20). These 
interactions could result in the formation of a stable three-member 
 term complex term , each member of which  term binds term  directly to the other two. beta-Catenin or gamma-catenin  term binds term  alpha-catenin, which 
in turn anchors the  term complex term es to the cytoskeleton, consistent 
with the increased cytoskeletal association of  term E-cadherin term , beta-catenin, and 
gamma-catenin induced 
by  term PS1 term .                                         View larger version

            Cadherins are expressed in specific patterns throughout the embryonic and 
adult life of vertebrates. At least 15 different classic 
cadherins have been detected in the central nervous system, where 
they function as guidance molecules in neurite target recognition and 
synapse formation and regulate synaptic plasticity (10, 11, 26, 27). The cadherin 
region critical for  term PS1 term   term binding term  is conserved in classic cadherins 
including E-, N-, P- (placental), R- (retinal), and vascular 
endothelial cadherin (18). This 
region is crucial for cell  term adhesion term  during embryogenesis (28), for 
N-cadherin-mediated neurite outgrowth (29), cell motility 
(30), 
and regulation of N- and vascular endothelial-cadherin expression 
in endothelial cell junctions (31). Thus  term PS1 term  may 
regulate the function of multiple cadherin systems during development 
and adult life. That  term PS1 term  is important for central nervous system 
development is suggested by  term PS1 term  null mice that die shortly after 
birth with severe abnormalities of CNS development and impaired 
vascular integrity (7). Members of the cadherin  term adhesion term   term complex term , including  term E-cadherin term , beta-catenin, and  term p120 term , have 
been identified as important oncogenes (15, 18, 32). That  term PS1 term  
regulates their association suggests that  term PS1 term  itself might be 
involved in cancer development.  term E-cadherin term  is the main  term adhesion term  
molecule of epithelia, and dysfunction of  term E-cadherin term   term complex term es has 
been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis of human epithelial 
cancer (32). 
That  term PS1 term  promotes cadherin  term adhesion term  raises the possibility that loss 
of  term PS1 term  function might decrease  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term  and promote cancer 
development. This model suggests an explanation for the surprising 
observation that  term PS1 term  down-regulation leads to the formation of 
epidermal tumors in adult mice (33). It is of great interest that in contrast to WT  term PS1 term ,  term PS1 term  FAD mutant DeltaE9 failed to increase 
 term cell-cell term  aggregation and stimulated neither formation of 
 term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term es nor the cytoskeletal association of 
cadherin and catenins. This mutant lacks the  term PS1 term  cleavage site and is 
not cleaved intracellularly (3, 4). 
Thus, the inability of this mutant to stimulate  term cell-cell term   term adhesion term  
may be due to a lack of functional  term PS1 term  fragments. We observed 
that uncleaved DeltaE9 mutant forms  term complex term es with  term E-cadherin term  (S.E. and 
N.K.R., unpublished observations), suggesting that incorporation of 
uncleaved  term PS1 term  into the  term cadherin/catenin term   term complex term  cannot substitute 
functionally for the  term PS1 term  fragments. It remains an interesting 
question whether the lack of function of mutant DeltaE9 contributes to the 
development of the FAD phenotype. Recent evidence shows that  term PS1 term  forms  term complex term es with APP and Notch-1 receptor 
and regulates production of Abeta (5, 6). Like 
 term E-cadherin term , APP and Notch-1 are type I transmembrane proteins, but 
the mechanism(s) involved in the  term PS1 term   term binding term  to APP and Notch-1 
receptor is still not clear. Our findings on the  term sequence term  involved 
in  term E-cadherin term / term PS1 term   term binding term  suggest a model for  term PS1 term   term binding term  to APP 
and Notch-1 receptors. In addition, cadherin is involved in cell 
 term adhesion term  and signaling, and APP may have similar functions (34, 35). That  term PS1 term  
forms  term complex term es with the APP, Notch-1, and  term E-cadherin term  systems 
suggests that in addition to APP processing,  term PS1 term  FAD mutations may 
target other type I transmembrane protein systems, including Notch-1 
and cadherins. That  term PS1 term  FAD mutants may affect an array of protein 
systems is in agreement with evidence that Alzheimer's disease is a 
heterogeneous disorder with multiple systems affected (36, 37).                AcknowledgementsWe thank Drs. Tonegawa and Potter for  term PS1 term +/- Tg mice, Dr. P. Saftig for
