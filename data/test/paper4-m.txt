Top              Abstract             Introduction              MATERIALS AND METHODS              RESULTS              DISCUSSION              References              Abstract                          Ovarian carcinomas are thought to arise in the <term>ovarian</term> surface             epithelium  <term>OSE</term> . Although this tissue forms a simple <term>epithelial</term>             covering on the <term>ovarian</term> surface, <term>OSE</term> cells exhibit some <term>mesenchymal</term>             characteristics and contain little or no E-cadherin. However,             <term>E-cadherin</term> is present in <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term> cells that resemble the             more complex epithelia of the oviduct, endometrium and endocervix,             and in primary <term>epithelial</term> <term>ovarian</term> carcinomas. To determine whether             <term>E-cadherin</term> was a cause or consequence of <term>OSE</term> metaplasia, we             expressed this cell-adhesion molecule in simian virus             40-immortalized <term>OSE</term> cells. In these cells the exogenous <term>E-cadherin</term>              all three catenins, and F-actin localized at sites of <term>cellâ€“cell</term>             contact, indicating the formation of functional adherens junctions.             Unlike the parent <term>OSE</term> cell line, which had undergone a typical             <term>mesenchymal</term> transformation in culture, E-cadherin-expressing cells             contained cytokeratins and the tight-junction protein occludin. They             also formed cobblestone monolayers in two-dimensional culture and             simple epithelia in three-dimensional culture that produced <term>CA125</term>             and shed it into the culture medium. <term>CA125</term> is a normal             epithelial-differentiation product of the oviduct, endometrium, and             endocervix, but not of normal OSE. It is also a tumor antigen that             is produced by <term>ovarian</term> neoplasms and by <term>metaplastic</term> OSE. Thus,             <term>E-cadherin</term> restored some normal characteristics of <term>OSE</term>  such as             keratin, and it also induced epithelial-differentiation markers             associated with weakly preneoplastic, <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term> and             OSE-derived primary carcinomas. The results suggest an unexpected             role for <term>E-cadherin</term> in <term>ovarian</term> neoplastic progression.             Top              Abstract              Introduction             MATERIALS AND METHODS              RESULTS              DISCUSSION              References              Introduction                          Epithelial <term>ovarian</term> carcinomas are the most prevalent and lethal of             all gynecological malignancies. Histopathological observations and             experimental data strongly suggest that these tumors arise from the             <term>ovarian</term> surface epithelium  <term>OSE</term>  (1â€“3). Despite their <term>epithelial</term>             morphology, <term>OSE</term> cells exhibit <term>mesenchymal</term> characteristics that             reflect their mesodermal origin. Specifically, normal <term>OSE</term> cells             rarely express the <term>epithelial</term> cell-adhesion molecule <term>E-cadherin</term>              they deposit stromal extracellular matrix proteins, and they produce             matrix-degrading metalloproteases (4â€“7). Such characteristics likely             contribute to the ability of <term>OSE</term> cells to rapidly undergo             <term>mesenchymal</term> transformation in monolayer culture (8). Although a             definitive premalignant lesion for <term>ovarian</term> carcinoma has not been             identified, <term>OSE</term> cell metaplasia is considered to be weakly             preneoplastic, particularly in women who are at increased risk of             developing the disease because of hereditary factors (2, 9).             Interestingly, <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term> cells, which are invariably             <term>epithelial</term>  often express <term>E-cadherin</term> (5, 6).            <term>E-cadherin</term> is a 120-kDa transmembrane, calcium-dependent             cell-adhesion molecule. Adhesion is initiated by the binding of             homologous <term>E-cadherin</term> extracellular domains on adjacent cells, and             it is stabilized by the association of the intracellular <term>E-cadherin</term>             domain with Î±, Î², and Î³ catenins that are physically linked to             F-actin to form functional adherens junctions (10, 11). <term>E-cadherin</term>             is required for <term>epithelial</term> histogenesis, tissue stabilization, and             differentiated function (12). Developmental down-regulation of             <term>E-cadherin</term>  which is initiated by morphogen-mediated signals that             cause a translocation of Î²-catenin to the nucleus, induces an             epithelial-to-mesenchymal conversion that is required for cell             migration and tissue rearrangements during embryogenesis (13). In             solid tumors, abnormal regulation or mutation of <term>E-cadherin</term> and             Î²-catenin contributes to the â€œmesenchyme-likeâ€? phenotype of many             late-stage, invasive carcinomas (14â€“16). Thus, E- cadherin acts as a             master regulator of the <term>epithelial</term> phenotype (17).            Although <term>E-cadherin</term> often is scanty or absent in <term>ovarian</term> carcinoma             metastases, it is almost always present in primary <term>ovarian</term>             carcinomas (18â€“23). At first glance it seems paradoxical that             <term>E-cadherin</term> expression is increased in <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term> and primary             <term>ovarian</term> tumors. However, both lesions often resemble the more             complex Mullerian duct-derived epithelia of the oviduct,             endometrium, or endocervix. The latter tissues and the <term>OSE</term> share a             common embryonic precursor, the urogenital coelomic epithelium.             Therefore, the appearance of Mullerian duct characteristics in             <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term> and primary <term>ovarian</term> carcinomas likely reflects an             aberrant differentiation toward tissue types of closely related             embryologic origin. To determine whether ectopic <term>E-cadherin</term>             expression is a cause or consequence of this aberrant             differentiation, we expressed the cell-adhesion molecule in normal             immortalized <term>OSE</term> cells.            Normal immortalized <term>OSE</term> cells transfected with a <term>mouse</term> <term>E-cadherin</term>             cDNA lost their <term>mesenchymal</term> characteristics and became             epithelialized. <term>E-cadherin</term>  all three catenins, and F-actin were             localized at <term>cellâ€“cell</term> borders, indicating the formation of             functional adherens junctions. In addition, the transfectants formed             tight junctions and re-expressed <term>epithelial</term> cytokeratins found in             normal <term>OSE</term> in vivo. In two-dimensional culture the transfectants             formed cobblestone <term>epithelial</term> monolayers, and in three-dimensional             sponge culture they formed simple <term>epithelial</term> linings. Furthermore,             the transfectants produced the <term>CA125</term> tumor antigen and shed it into             the culture medium. <term>CA125</term> is produced by <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term> in vivo,             and a sustained, high level of this antigen in a patient's serum is             an indicator of <term>ovarian</term> carcinoma (24). However, <term>CA125</term> also is a             normal differentiation product of endometrial, oviductal, and             endocervical epithelia, which <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term> resembles both             histologically and cytologically (25). Therefore, <term>E-cadherin</term>             expression restored some characteristics of normal <term>OSE</term> that had been             lost in culture, and it initiated a <term>metaplastic</term>  epithelialized             phenotype that shares some characteristics with neoplastic OSE.             Top              Abstract              Introduction              MATERIALS AND METHODS             RESULTS              DISCUSSION              References              MATERIALS AND METHODS                          Cell Culture and Transfection. The <term>IOSE-29</term> cell line (referred to as             IOSE-Mar in previous publications) was generated by transfecting             normal <term>human</term> <term>OSE</term> cells in passage 5 with the immortalizing simian             virus 40 virus early genes (26). <term>IOSE-29</term> cells lack keratin because             they have undergone epitheliomesenchymal conversion, which is             typical of cultured <term>OSE</term> (8). <term>IOSE-29</term> cells at passage 11 were             cotransfected (Lipofectamine; Life Technologies) with pSV2neo (27)             and a full-length <term>mouse</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> cDNA under the control of the             Î²-actin promoter (28). The cells were selected under G418 (50             Î¼g/ml), which generated a heterogeneous population of cells,             designated IOSE-29pre-EC. A homogeneous <term>epithelial</term> population then             was selected by differential adhesion. Briefly, after trypsinization             G418-selected cells were allowed to adhere to tissue culture dishes             for 30 min and unattached cells were removed by gentle pipette             flushing. The adherent <term>epithelial</term> population was designated             IOSE-29EC. Parental cells sham-transfected with SV2neo alone were             designated IOSE-29neo. Parental and sham-transfected cells yielded             no <term>epithelial</term> colonies after differential adhesion. Control cell             lines used included <term>human</term> <term>ovarian</term> carcinoma OVCAR-3 cells, which             express <term>human</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> and <term>CA125</term> (29); <term>mouse</term> mammary <term>epithelial</term>             scp2 cells, which express <term>mouse</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> (30); <term>human</term> cervical             carcinoma C4-II cells (31), which express the cytokeratins 7, 8, 18,             and 19 that are found in normal OSEin vivo (8); and canine kidney             <term>epithelial</term> MDCK cells, which express tight junctional occludin. For             monolayer culture, cells were maintained on tissue culture dishes             (Falcon; Life Technologies) in a 1:1 mixture of 199/MCDB 105 medium             (Sigma) supplemented with 5% FBS. For three-dimensional culture,             cells were maintained in pig-skin-derived, dehydrated collagenous             sponge matrices (ref. 32; Spongostan, Health Design Industries,             Rochester NY) or reconstituted basement membrane gels (Matrigel;             Collaborative Research).            Immunofluorescence, Immunocytochemistry, and Immunoblotting. For             immunofluorescence, cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in             cold methanol, and postfixed in cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for all             antigens except the catenins, which were fixed in buffered             paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with digitonin. The             cells were incubated with antibodies that recognize both <term>human</term> and             <term>mouse</term> <term>E-cadherin</term>  <term>mouse</term> monoclonal; Transduction Laboratories,             Lexington, KY), Î±-catenin (rabbit polyclonal; Sigma), Î²- and             Î³-catenins  <term>mouse</term> monoclonals, Transduction Laboratories), or             pan-cytokeratin (rabbit polyclonal, Dako). Binding of primary             antibodies was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy after             incubation with fluorescently labeled, species-specific second             antibodies. F-actin was assessed by using rhodamine phalloidin             (Molecular Probes). For <term>CA125</term> immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed             in 10% buffered formalin, incubated with the mAb OC-125, and             processed as described (33).            For <term>E-cadherin</term> and catenin immunoblotting, whole-cell RIPA lysates             (0.1% SDS/1% deoxycholate/1% NP-40) were separated by 10% SDS/PAGE,             transferred to nylon membranes (Bio-Rad), and probed with the             primary antibodies described above as well as a <term>mouse</term> monoclonal             that is specific for <term>human</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> (HECD-1; Zymed) (34). Antibody             binding was visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham             Pharmacia). For keratin immunoblotting, 30 Î¼g of solubilized             cytoskeletal protein was separated by 8.5% SDS/PAGE, transferred to             membranes, and probed with either a 1:1 mixture of AE1/AE3 mAbs,             which, together, detect all basic and acidic cytokeratins (CKs)             except CK-18 (31), or an anti-CK-18-specific mAb (Boehringer             Mannheim). For <term>CA125</term> immunoblotting, cell lysates (100 Î¼g; 0.1%             Tween 20) or conditioned medium (300 Î¼g) from subconfluent cultures             was separated on nondenaturing 5% SDS/PAGE gels, transferred to             membranes, and immunoblotted with OC-125 as described (35). <term>CA125</term>             levels also were assessed by microparticle enzyme immunoassay per             the manufacturer's specifications (Abbott).             Top              Abstract              Introduction              MATERIALS AND METHODS              RESULTS             DISCUSSION              References              RESULTS                          In monolayer culture, normal <term>human</term> <term>OSE</term> cells, which lack <term>E-cadherin</term>              frequently undergo a <term>mesenchymal</term> conversion (8). The cells become             fibroblastic and stop expressing cytokeratins. This <term>mesenchymal</term>             phenotype is maintained in <term>OSE</term> cell lines whose lifespan has been             extended by the simian virus 40 large T antigen (26). The <term>IOSE-29</term>             line is a typical example, because it lacks <term>E-cadherin</term> (Figs. 1 and             2 A) and forms fibroblastic monolayers (Fig. 3 A) that are             keratin-negative (Fig. 4 C).             In the present study, <term>IOSE-29</term> cells were cotransfected with a <term>mouse</term>             <term>E-cadherin</term> cDNA and a pSV2neo selection vector. After selection             under G418, the resulting population, designated IOSE-29pre-EC, was             heterogeneous, containing mostly fibroblastic cells that were             interspersed with small, compact <term>epithelial</term> islands. The <term>epithelial</term>             cells, which were slow-growing compared with the fibroblastic cells,             were not amenable to limited dilution cloning but they adhered to             tissue culture dishes very rapidly after passaging. Therefore, we             used a differential adhesion strategy (see Materials and Methods) to             produce an homogeneous <term>epithelial</term> population, designated IOSE-29EC.             Differential adhesion of the parental untransfected <term>IOSE-29</term> cells             and sham-transfected IOSE-29neo cells did not generate <term>epithelial</term>             populations.            To rule out the possibility that the <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells might have             represented a minor variant of the parental population that             expressed endogenous <term>human</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> rather than the exogenous             <term>mouse</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> cDNA, we carried out Western blotting with two             different <term>E-cadherin</term> antibodies (Fig. 1 A). The blots were probed             with an antibody that recognizes both <term>human</term> and <term>mouse</term> <term>E-cadherin</term>             (Fig. 1 A Upper). Control cell lines that express <term>human</term> (lane 1) and             <term>mouse</term> (lane 2) <term>E-cadherin</term> were both positive when using this             antibody, parental <term>IOSE-29</term> (lane 3) and IOSE-29neo (lane 4) cells             were both negative, and IOSE-29pre-EC (lane 5) and <term>IOSE-29EC</term> (lane             6) cells were both positive. In Fig. 1 A (Lower), which was probed             with an antibody that specifically recognizes only <term>human</term> <term>E-cadherin</term>             (34), none of the <term>OSE</term> cell lines, either untransfected or             transfected, was positive. Therefore, we conclude that the             IOSE-29pre-EC and <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells expressed exogenous <term>mouse</term>             E-cadherin. Interestingly, however, we found that after repeated             passaging, <term>IOSE-29EC</term>  but not untransfected <term>IOSE-29</term> or the             sham-transfected IOSE-29neo cells, began to express <term>human</term> <term>E-cadherin</term>             (data not shown). This raises the intriguing possibility that             <term>E-cadherin</term> can positively regulate its own expression in <term>OSE</term> cells.            When Western blots were overloaded with 100 Î¼g of total protein we             still could not detect the 120-kDa <term>E-cadherin</term> in the parental             <term>IOSE-29</term> cells (Fig. 1 B), and the protein was not observed by             immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, <term>E-cadherin</term> was             present and appropriately localized at areas of <term>cellâ€“cell</term> contact in             the <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells (Figs. 1 B and 2 B). Although parental <term>IOSE-29</term>             cells contained detectable levels of the 102-kDa Î±-catenin and the             94-kDa Î²-catenin (Fig. 1 B), both proteins were dispersed throughout             the cell and they were only discontinuously located at sites of             <term>cellâ€“cell</term> contact (Fig. 2 C and E). The steady-state levels of             Î±-catenin and Î²-catenin were increased significantly in <term>IOSE-29EC</term>             cells (Fig. 1 B), and both proteins were localized almost             exclusively at <term>cellâ€“cell</term> contacts (Fig. 2 D and F). Parental <term>IOSE-29</term>             cells contained very little of the 86-kDa Î³-catenin (Figs. 1 B and 2             G), but this protein was induced in the <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells and it was             also located at <term>cellâ€“cell</term> contacts (Fig. 2 H). F-actin was localized             in prominent <term>mesenchymal</term> cytoplasmic stress fibers in <term>IOSE-29</term> cells             (Fig. 2 I), but it was redistributed to areas of <term>cellâ€“cell</term> contact             in <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells (Fig. 2 J). The colocalization of <term>E-cadherin</term>  all             three catenins, and F-actin at <term>cellâ€“cell</term> contacts indicates that the             <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells formed functional <term>epithelial</term> adherens junctions             (11). At no time did we observe <term>epithelial</term> <term>cellâ€“cell</term> junction             formation in the sham-transfected IOSE-29neo cells (data not shown).             Adherens junctions link <term>epithelial</term> cells into cohesive, cobblestone             monolayers. The <term>mesenchymal</term> <term>IOSE-29</term> cells were fibroblastic at low             cell density (Fig. 3 A), and at high cell density the bipolar shape             of the cells was accentuated (Fig. 3 C). On the other hand,             <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells were packed closely and <term>epithelial</term> at low cell             density (Fig. 3 B), and at high cell density they formed cobblestone             monolayers with bulging hemicystic domes (Fig. 3 D). The presence of             domes suggested that <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells formed tight junctions (see             Fig. 4).             The <term>mesenchymal</term> characteristics of the parental <term>IOSE-29</term> line were             clearly evident in three-dimensional sponge culture (Fig. 3 E). The             cells migrated into the spaces between the sponge spicules, which             likely reflects their ability to deposit a stromal extracellular             matrix (4, 32). In contrast, <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells formed simple epithelia             that lined the sponge spicules (Fig. 3 F). Morphological differences             between the parent and transfected lines also were apparent in             three-dimensional basement membrane gels. Under these conditions,             the <term>IOSE-29</term> cells formed cell aggregates with radiating branching             cords that invaded the gel (Fig. 3 G) whereas <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells formed             tightly packed <term>epithelial</term> spheres with no evidence of invasion (Fig.             3 H).            The morphology of the E-cadherin-transfected cells suggested that             they were functionally epithelialized. To confirm this tentative             conclusion we examined cytokeratin expression. As expected (8, 26),             the <term>mesenchymal</term> <term>IOSE-29</term> cells did not express CK (Fig. 4 A and C).             The same was true of the sham-transfected IOSE-29neo cells (data not             shown). On the other hand, <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells contained the simple             <term>epithelial</term> CK7, CK18, and CK 19 (Fig. 4 A), which formed classical             intermediate filament arrays (Fig. 4 D). We also examined the             tight-junction protein occludin (36). <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells, but not the             parental line, expressed significant amounts of occludin (Fig. 4 B),             which was localized at sites of <term>cellâ€“cell</term> contact (Fig. 4 E and F).             These data, and the formation of domes in monolayer culture,             indicated the presence of tight junctions in the epithelialized             <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells.            Unlike Mullerian duct-derived epithelia, normal <term>OSE</term> cells do not             express the CA 125 tumor antigen in vivo or in culture (25, 33). The             same was true of both <term>IOSE-29</term> (Fig. 5 A and B) and sham-transfected             IOSE-29neo cells (data not shown). In contrast, broad-molecular-mass             CA125-containing protein species between approximately 500 and 700             kDa were found in <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cell lysates and conditioned medium             (Fig. 5 A). It should be noted, however, that the <term>CA125</term> shed into             the medium by <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells was qualitatively different from that             produced by OVCAR-3 carcinoma cells, which suggests that there may             be differences in <term>CA125</term> glycosylation by the two cell lines. The             <term>CA125</term> tumor antigen also was detected on the surface of <term>IOSE-29EC</term>             cells by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 5 C) and in cell lysates and             conditioned medium by using the microparticle enzyme immunoassay             (Table 1). The latter levels were comparable to those of OVCAR-3             carcinoma cells. Therefore, the evidence was overwhelming that <term>CA125</term>             was being produced by the epithelialized <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells, indicating             that exogenous <term>E-cadherin</term> expression induced an aberrant Mullerian             duct-like differentiation that is a hallmark of <term>OSE</term> metaplasia and             neoplasia.              Top              Abstract              Introduction              MATERIALS AND METHODS              RESULTS              DISCUSSION             References              DISCUSSION                          The genetic basis for familial predisposition to <term>epithelial</term> <term>ovarian</term>             cancer is now being elucidated (36â€“39). However, in both familial             and sporadic <term>ovarian</term> cancers, definitive premalignant lesions have             not been identified. As a result, at the time of diagnosis the             disease often has progressed to its later stages and the prognosis             is invariably poor. In the present study we examined the basis of             the <term>metaplastic</term> and early neoplastic changes that occur in the <term>OSE</term>              the presumptive target tissue in <term>ovarian</term> carcinogenesis, in an             effort to identify early predictive markers of these neoplasms. The             results present an unexpected role for <term>E-cadherin</term> in carcinogenesis             and identify a differentiation-related step that seems to contribute             to early <term>ovarian</term> neoplastic progression.            The <term>OSE</term> arises from the urogenital coelomic epithelium, as do the             Mullerian duct-derived epithelia that line the oviduct, endometrium,             and endocervix. However, unlike Mullerian duct-derived epithelia,             normal <term>OSE</term> rarely contains the <term>epithelial</term> <term>cellâ€“cell</term> adhesion             molecule <term>E-cadherin</term> (5â€“7). Normal <term>OSE</term> do express N-cadherin (23,             40), which is a cell-adhesion molecule that can cause <term>cellâ€“cell</term>             junction disassembly and cell migration when it is expressed             inappropriately (41). Thus, the presence of N-cadherin in normal <term>OSE</term>             cells may contribute to their propensity to undergo <term>mesenchymal</term>             conversion in culture. In this study, the <term>mesenchymal</term>             characteristics of the normal <term>IOSE-29</term> line were readily apparent in             three-dimensional sponge culture in which fibroblastic, bipolar             cells migrated into the spaces between the sponge spicules.            In vivo, Mullerian metaplasia of <term>OSE</term> is common, and it usually has             little or no pathological consequence (2). However, the incidence of             metaplasia is increased in women with a familial predisposition to             <term>ovarian</term> cancer, and both dysplasia and rare cases of carcinoma have             been observed within these lesions (9). In contrast to normal <term>OSE</term>              <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term> and primary <term>ovarian</term> carcinomas both contain             <term>E-cadherin</term> (5â€“7). When we produced cells that expressed high levels             of <term>E-cadherin</term>  they were no longer fibroblastic. Instead, these             cells, designated <term>IOSE-29EC</term>  formed closely packed <term>epithelial</term>             monolayers. Several lines of evidence indicate that the             epithelialization of <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells was caused by expression of the             transfected <term>mouse</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> cDNA and not by the selection of a             preexisting subpopulation of <term>metaplastic</term> cells present in the             parental line: (i) no <term>E-cadherin</term> positive cells were ever observed             in the parental <term>IOSE-29</term> or sham-transfected IOSE-29neo lines; (ii)             differential adhesion of <term>IOSE-29</term> and IOSE-29neo cells never yielded             <term>epithelial</term> colonies; (iii) cytokeratins and/or <term>CA125</term> were never             observed in <term>IOSE-29</term> and IOSE-29neo lines, although these markers             characterize the <term>IOSE-29EC</term> line (see below); (iv) low levels of             <term>E-cadherin</term> were present in IOSE-29preEC cells before differential             adhesion; and (v) the <term>E-cadherin</term> present in IOSE-29pre-EC and             <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells was the exogenous <term>mouse</term>  not the endogenous <term>human</term>              protein.            Exogenous <term>E-cadherin</term> expression causes a partial <term>epithelial</term>             transformation of true fibroblasts, at least with respect to             <term>cellâ€“cell</term> junction formation (42, 43). In contrast, <term>epithelial</term> cell             junctions were fully developed in <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells as judged by the             following criteria: f-actin was found in plasma membrane-associated             circumferential rings; <term>E-cadherin</term>  Î±-catenin, Î²-catenin, and             Î³-catenin all colocalized with the F-actin rings in adherens             junctions; and occludin was up-regulated and localized to sites of             <term>cellâ€“cell</term> contact, indicating the formation of secondary tight             junctions. Functionally, these <term>epithelial</term> cell junctions supported             vectorial ion transport as <term>IOSE-29EC</term> formed hemicystic domes in             high-density monolayer culture. Such domes are never found in             cultures of normal <term>mesenchymal</term> <term>OSE</term>  but they are common in <term>ovarian</term>             carcinoma cultures. <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells also reexpressed cytokeratins,             which are found in normal OSEin vivo (8), and they formed <term>epithelial</term>             linings on sponge spicules that were reminiscent of <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term>             trapped within surface invaginations and inclusion cysts.            In many types of <term>epithelial</term> tumors, down-regulation or mutation of             <term>E-cadherin</term> is associated with an increased invasiveness that can be             prevented by the forced expression of the cell-adhesion molecule.             This suggests that <term>E-cadherin</term> is a late-stage tumor suppressor that             prevents invasion and metastasis (14). Because <term>E-cadherin</term> is             expressed in most epithelia, it is assumed that its presence in             primary, differentiated tumors is a characteristic of the target             tissue that has been retained during the early stages of             carcinogenesis. However, the frequent presence of <term>E-cadherin</term> in             primary <term>ovarian</term> carcinomas (18â€“23) must be acquired during             carcinogenesis because it is rarely present in normal <term>OSE</term> (5â€“7).             Although the subsequent loss of <term>E-cadherin</term> undoubtedly plays a role             in late-stage <term>ovarian</term> metastasis, our data suggest that ectopic             expression of the cell-adhesion molecule initiates early             preneoplastic changes by committing <term>OSE</term> cells to a more complex             <term>epithelial</term> phenotype that restricts their <term>mesenchymal</term> potential.             From a mechanistic point of view this phenotypic modulation could be             mediated by changes in the subcellular localization of Î²-catenin             (11â€“13).            An important phenotypic consequence of <term>OSE</term> epithelialization in             <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells was the secretion of the <term>CA125</term> tumor antigen. In             vivo, <term>CA125</term> is produced by <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term>  and high levels of the             antigen in a patient's serum is an indicator of <term>ovarian</term> carcinoma             (25). We recently have produced a second E-cadherin-transfected IOSE             line derived independently from a separate normal <term>human</term> donor that             also produces <term>CA125</term> (data not shown). Thus, the E-cadherin-induced             <term>CA125</term> tumor antigen production observed in <term>IOSE-29EC</term> cells was not a             unique, isolated event.            The <term>CA125</term> tumor antigen is a normal differentiation product of             oviductal, endometrial, and endocervical epithelia. Therefore, our             finding that E-cadherin-induced <term>CA125</term> production in <term>OSE</term> cells puts             to rest any lingering doubts regarding this tissue's ability to             acquire the Mullerian characteristics observed in <term>metaplastic</term> <term>OSE</term>             and <term>ovarian</term> carcinomas. The mechanism by which <term>E-cadherin</term> induces             <term>CA125</term> production in <term>OSE</term> cells remains unclear because the gene that             codes the core protein has not yet been cloned, probably because,             until now, it has not been possible to regulate the gene's             expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the             expression of exogenous <term>E-cadherin</term> in <term>mesenchymal</term> <term>IOSE-29</term> cells not             only restored the <term>epithelial</term> properties of normal <term>OSE</term> but, in             addition, induced novel characteristics of <term>metaplastic</term> and             neoplastic <term>OSE</term> such as tight junctions and <term>CA125</term> production. Thus,             as is not the case in the great majority of other <term>epithelial</term>             tissues, the ectopic expression of <term>E-cadherin</term> frequently observed in             <term>metaplastic</term> and neoplastic <term>OSE</term> may play a functional role in the             earliest stages of <term>ovarian</term> tumor development.
