This <term>binding</term> is mediated by the large cytoplasmic loop of <term>PS1</term> and requires the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic <term>sequence</term> 604-615 of mature E-cadherin. This <term>sequence</term> is also required for <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>binding</term> of protein <term>p120</term>  a known regulator of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Using wild-type and <term>PS1</term> knockout cells, we found that increasing <term>PS1</term> levels suppresses p120/E-cadherin <term>binding</term>  and increasing <term>p120</term> levels suppresses PS1/E-cadherin binding. Thus <term>PS1</term> and <term>p120</term> bind to and mutually compete for cellular E-cadherin. Furthermore, <term>PS1</term> stimulates <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>binding</term> to beta- and gamma-catenin, promotes cytoskeletal association of the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complexes</term>  and increases Ca2+-dependent <term>cell-cell</term> aggregation. Remarkably, <term>PS1</term> familial Alzheimer disease mutant DeltaE9 increased neither the levels of <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complexes</term> nor cell aggregation, suggesting that this familial Alzheimer disease mutation interferes with cadherin-based <term>cell-cell</term> adhesion. These data identify <term>PS1</term> as an E-cadherin-binding protein and a regulator of <term>E-cadherin</term> function in vivo.                Introduction        Top Abstract Introduction Materials and       Methods Results       Discussion References Presenilin-1  <term>PS1</term>  mutations are responsible for most cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). <term>PS1</term> is a transmembrane protein expressed in many tissues, including brain, where it is enriched in neurons (1, 2). <term>PS1</term> crosses the membrane eight times, with the N terminus, the C terminus, and the large hydrophilic loop all located in the cytoplasm. Most cellular <term>PS1</term> is cleaved within the large cytoplasmic loop to yield N-terminal fragments (PS1/NTF) of approximately 30 kDa and C-terminal fragments  <term>PS1/CTF</term>  of approximately 20 kDa. After cleavage, the <term>PS1</term> fragments form stable 1:1 heterodimers (3, 4). <term>PS1</term> facilitates processing of Notch-1 receptor, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) (5, 6) stimulates production of Abeta peptide (6) and may play a role in neuroprotection (7, 8). Mice lacking <term>PS1</term>  <term>PS1-/-</term>  die shortly after birth with skeletal malformations, impaired neurogenesis, and brain hemorrhage (7). Recently, we reported that <term>PS1</term> concentrates at synaptic and epithelial <term>cell-cell</term> contact sites, where it forms <term>complexes</term> with the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>adhesion</term> system (9). Classic cadherins, including <term>E-cadherin</term> and neuronal cadherin (N-cadherin), are a family of type I transmembrane proteins that mediate Ca2+-dependent <term>cell-cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> and recognition, and control critical events in neurogenesis, tissue development, and tissue homeostasis (10, 11). These functions are mediated by homophilic interactions of the extracellular region of cadherins. The membrane-distal cytoplasmic <term>sequence</term> of cadherins <term>binds</term> either beta-catenin or gamma-catenin (plakoglobin), which in turn <term>binds</term> alpha-catenin. The latter protein <term>binds</term> polymerized actin, thus linking the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>adhesion</term> <term>complex</term> to the cortical cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal linkage of the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complexes</term> is crucial for the full expression of the adhesive functions of surface cadherins (12-14). beta-Catenin and gamma-catenin, two highly homologous members of the armadillo family of proteins (for a review see ref. 15), bind the same <term>sequence</term> of cytoplasmic cadherin in a mutually exclusive manner (16, 17). The juxtamembrane (membrane-proximal) region of cytoplasmic cadherins <term>binds</term> <term>p120</term> (also called p120ctn), a cytosolic protein originally identified as a target for p60v-src kinase and later shown to regulate cadherin-mediated <term>cell-cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> and tumor metastasis (for a review see ref. 18). Although <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> to the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>adhesion</term> <term>complex</term> (9), the mechanism and functional consequences of this association remain obscure. Here we show that <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> directly to juxtamembrane cytoplasmic cadherin and inhibits cadherin <term>binding</term> of p120. Furthermore, <term>PS1</term> stabilizes the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complex</term>  promotes its cytoskeletal association, and stimulates Ca2+-dependent <term>cell-cell</term> aggregation. In contrast, <term>PS1</term> FAD mutant DeltaE9 failed to stabilize the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complex</term> and did not stimulate <term>cell-cell</term> aggregation.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody R222 specific for PS1/NTF amino acids 2-12 and mouse monoclonal antibody 33B10 specific for <term>PS1/CTF</term> <term>sequence</term> 331-350 were prepared as described (9). Anti-transferrin receptor antibody was from Zymed, and anti-epithelial cadherin  <term>E-cadherin</term>  antibody H108 (rabbit polyclonal) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cell Cultures, Cell Aggregation, Immunoprecipitations  <term>IPs</term> , and Immunoblotting. Unless otherwise stated, cell cultures were grown in DMEM plus 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Fibroblast cell lines were from wild-type (WT)  <term>PS1</term> +/+) and <term>PS1</term> knockout  <term>PS1-/-</term>  mice (9), and L cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Stable transfections of <term>E-cadherin</term> cDNAs cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) were performed as described (2, 9). Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine Plus, and cells were processed for IP or cell aggregation 36 h later. Aggregation assays were performed as described (9, 12) in the presence or absence of 2 mM Ca2+. The degree of aggregation and size of aggregates was documented by photography. <term>IPs</term> were performed as described (9) and analyzed on Western blots (WBs). Mouse embryos at day 17 were rinsed in ice-cold PBS and frozen in a dry ice/methanol bath. Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of tail DNA (7), and frozen PS1+/+ or <term>PS1-/-</term> embryos were homogenized in ice-cold TNE buffer [25 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.6)/150 mM NaCl/1× complete protease inhibitor mixture/1 mM EDTA] plus 1% <term>Triton</term> X-100. Homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted. All experiments were repeated at least three times, except the crosslinking, which was repeated two times. Crosslinking. Confluent cells were rinsed twice with PBS minus Ca2+/Mg2+ and then incubated in the same buffer plus 200 µg/ml of dithiobis[succinimidylpropionate] (Pierce) for 20 min at room temperature. After that, cells were rinsed as above, incubated 5 min in quenching solution (50 mM glycine in PBS, pH 7.4), and solubilized in RIPA buffer [25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4)/1% Nonidet P-40/0.1% SDS/0.5% sodium deoxycholate/complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)]. Preparation of Triton-Insoluble, Urea-Soluble Fractions. Confluent <term>PS1</term> +/+ or <term>PS1-/-</term> fibroblast cell cultures in 60-mm plates were extracted with 300 µl of TNE buffer plus 1% <term>Triton</term> X-100 and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the <term>Triton</term> X-100-insoluble fraction was solubilized in 100 µl SDS sample buffer plus urea [70 mM Tris·HCl (pH 6.8)/8 M urea/2.5% SDS/0.1 M DTT/10% glycerol]. Triton-soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed on WBs.                Results        Top Abstract Introduction Materials and       Methods Results Discussion       References PS1/E-cadherin Binding Is Independent of Catenins. <term>PS1</term> is a component of the E-cadherin/beta-catenin <term>adhesion</term> <term>complex</term> (9). Examination of <term>E-cadherin</term>  gamma-catenin, and <term>PS1</term> <term>IPs</term> prepared from confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cultures (9) revealed that <term>PS1</term> is also a component of the E-cadherin/gamma-catenin <term>complex</term> (Fig. 1A). Because <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> beta-catenin (19, 20), we attempted to determine whether <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> independent of catenins. <term>Triton</term> X-100 extracted most of <term>PS1/CTF</term> from a beta-catenin IP but failed to extract any <term>PS1/CTF</term> from an <term>E-cadherin</term> IP, indicating that the PS1/E-cadherin <term>binding</term> might be distinct from the PS1/beta-catenin <term>binding</term> (Fig. 1B, Lower). To further test this hypothesis, we prepared <term>PS1</term> <term>IPs</term> from L cells transfected with either full-length <term>E-cadherin</term> (EL cells) or with <term>E-cadherin</term> deletion construct EDeltaC71 that lacks the last (membrane-distal) 71 cytoplasmic amino acids that bind beta- and gamma-catenin (EDeltaC71L cells; see Fig. 2A). Untransfected L cells contain no detectable <term>E-cadherin</term> (21), and <term>PS1</term> <term>IPs</term> from these cells did not react with anti-E-cadherin antibodies (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 5). In E-cadherin-transfected cells, however, <term>PS1</term> formed <term>complexes</term> with both full-length and EDeltaC71 cadherins (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3 and 6 and 7). Because construct EDeltaC71 lacks the catenin-binding <term>sequence</term> and <term>binds</term> neither beta- nor gamma-catenin (data not shown; see also refs. 14 and 22), our data show that <term>PS1</term> associates with <term>E-cadherin</term> even when catenins are not bound to E-cadherin. Chemical crosslinking is used to analyze direct protein-protein contacts within protein <term>complexes</term>  including the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complex</term> (22, 23). <term>PS1</term> <term>IPs</term> prepared from crosslinked EL or EDeltaC71L cells contained E-cadherin-reactive, SDS-resistant <term>complexes</term> of approximate apparent molecular mass 170 kDa and 160 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2C). The apparent molecular mass of the crosslinked products is in excellent agreement with the predicted molecular mass of a ternary <term>complex</term> containing one molecule each of <term>PS1/CTF</term>  PS1/NTF, and full length or truncated <term>E-cadherin</term>  respectively. These <term>complexes</term> were immunoprecipitated with anti-PS1/NTF antibody R222 and reacted with anti-PS1/CTF antibody 33B10, verifying that they contain both <term>PS1</term> fragments (Fig. 2C). These data show that <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> directly to <term>E-cadherin</term> at a <term>sequence</term> distinct from the catenin-binding site and suggest that the two proteins combine in a 1:1 ratio.

Constructs were prepared as previously described (25).             (B) <term>PS1</term> <term>binding</term> to <term>E-cadherin</term> constructs. Extracts (1%             digitonin) from L cells (L, lanes 1, 5, and 9) or L cells             transfected with mouse <term>E-cadherin</term> (EL, lanes 2, 6, and             10), construct EDeltaC71 (EDeltaC71L, lanes 3, 7, and 11), or construct             EDeltaC71Delta604-615 (EDeltaC71Delta604-615L, lanes             4, 8, and 12) were treated with antibody R222 (lanes 5-8)             or anti-p120 antibody (lanes 9-12), and the resulting <term>IPs</term> were             probed on WBs with anti-E-cadherin antibody H108. For reference,             20 µg of cell lysates was probed (lanes 1-4). (C)             Confluent EL or EDeltaC71L cells were incubated either with the             crosslinking agent dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) in DMSO             or with DMSO alone, and cell extracts were then prepared in RIPA             buffer in the presence of SDS to inhibit noncovalent associations.             Lysates were treated with antibody R222 (R222 IP), and the resulting             <term>IPs</term> were probed on WBs with anti-E-cadherin (H108) or anti-PS1/CTF             (33B10) antibodies. Twenty micrograms of cell lysate was probed with             H108 antibody. (D) <term>PS1</term> construct Delta340-375 does not bind             E-cadherin. HEK293 cells expressing WT <term>PS1</term> (WT) or a <term>PS1</term> construct             with amino acid deletion 340-375 (Delta340-375) were lysed in             TNE plus 1% digitonin. Lysates were treated with anti-E-cadherin             antibody (E-cad IP), and the resulting <term>IPs</term> were probed on WBs with             antibody 33B10. Twenty micrograms of cell lysates was also probed.             <term>PS1/CTF</term> Mediates <term>PS1</term> Binding to Juxtamembrane Cytoplasmic E-cadherin. <term>Triton</term> X-100 treatment of a digitonin <term>E-cadherin</term> IP extracted the PS1/NTF but not the <term>PS1/CTF</term>  which remained associated with <term>E-cadherin</term> (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that <term>PS1</term> <term>binding</term> to <term>E-cadherin</term> may be mediated by peptide <term>PS1/CTF</term> and is in agreement with recent data that the <term>binding</term> between PS1/NTF and <term>PS1/CTF</term> is sensitive to <term>Triton</term> X-100 extraction (20). Together with the chemical crosslinking data (see above), these results suggest that <term>PS1/CTF</term>  which contains <term>PS1</term> <term>sequence</term> 299-467 (3), mediates the PS1/E-cadherin binding. In vitro blot overlay assays showed that <term>PS1</term> <term>sequence</term> 256-410, which includes the entire large cytoplasmic loop, <term>binds</term> to the cytoplasmic <term>sequence</term> of <term>E-cadherin</term> (data not shown). Fig. 2D shows that, whereas full-length <term>PS1/CTF</term> bound <term>E-cadherin</term> in vivo, a <term>PS1/CTF</term> construct lacking <term>sequence</term> 340-375 did not. In contrast, <term>PS1/CTF</term> construct lacking <term>sequence</term> 299-330 bound <term>E-cadherin</term> (data not shown). Combined, these results show that <term>PS1</term> <term>sequence</term> 340-375 of the large cytoplasmic loop is required for <term>PS1</term> <term>binding</term> to cytoplasmic E-cadherin. The observation that <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> lacking the last 71 cytoplasmic residues, combined with in vitro experiments showing that the <term>PS1</term> <term>sequence</term> <term>binds</term> cytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term>  suggested that <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> within the remaining membrane proximal 80 residues of cytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term> (Fig. 2A). Because these residues also mediate <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>binding</term> of protein <term>p120</term>  a regulator of cadherin-mediated cell <term>adhesion</term> (21, 24), we asked whether there is an overlap between the <term>E-cadherin</term> sequences that mediate <term>binding</term> of both proteins. Indeed, deletion of <term>E-cadherin</term> cytoplasmic <term>sequence</term> 604-615, which is required for <term>p120</term> <term>binding</term> to <term>E-cadherin</term> (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 12; and ref. 21), also abolished E-cadherin-PS1 <term>binding</term> (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 8), showing that this <term>sequence</term> is critical for <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>binding</term> of both <term>PS1</term> and p120. <term>PS1</term> Competes with <term>p120</term> for <term>E-cadherin</term> Binding in Vivo. That the same <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>sequence</term> is required for <term>binding</term> of both <term>PS1</term> and <term>p120</term> suggests that these proteins might compete for <term>E-cadherin</term> binding. Indeed, <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>IPs</term> prepared from <term>PS1-/-</term> mouse embryos contained significantly more <term>p120</term> than <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>IPs</term> from PS1+/+ embryos (Fig. 3A). To further explore this phenomenon, we used fibroblast cells derived from <term>PS1-/-</term> and PS1+/+ mice. Because these cells express undetectable levels of endogenous <term>E-cadherin</term>  we transfected both of them and selected lines expressing similar levels of exogenous human <term>E-cadherin</term> (Fig. 3B). As expected, transfected <term>E-cadherin</term> coimmunoprecipitated with peptide <term>PS1/CTF</term> in PS1+/+ cells but not in <term>PS1-/-</term> cells (Fig. 3C; see also Fig. 5A, Right, for the reverse experiment). <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>IPs</term> prepared from <term>PS1-/-</term> cells contained significantly higher levels of <term>p120</term> than did <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>IPs</term> from PS1+/+ cells (Fig. 3D, Left), even though the two cell lines contain similar levels of cellular <term>p120</term> (Fig. 3D, Lower Right). In the reverse experiments, <term>p120</term> <term>IPs</term> from <term>PS1-/-</term> cells contained more <term>E-cadherin</term> than did <term>p120</term> <term>IPs</term> from PS1+/+ cells (Fig. 3D, Upper Right). Reintroduction of <term>PS1</term> into <term>PS1-/-</term> cells by transfection reduced the E-cadherin/p120 <term>complex</term> (Fig. 3E Left and Middle) and induced the appearance of the E-cadherin/PS1 <term>complex</term> (Fig. 3E Right). These data show that <term>PS1</term> inhibits <term>p120</term> <term>binding</term> to E-cadherin. Conversely, overexpression of <term>p120</term> in EL cells decreased the E-cadherin/PS1 <term>complex</term> while it increased the E-cadherin/p120 <term>complex</term> (Fig. 3F, Lower and Upper, respectively). Thus, <term>p120</term> is also capable of inhibiting <term>PS1</term> <term>binding</term> to E-cadherin. In summary, our data show that <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> and promotes the dissociation of the E-cadherin/p120 complex. The reverse is also true; <term>p120</term> <term>binds</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> and promotes the dissociation of the E-cadherin/PS1 complex. Taken together, our results indicate that the two proteins compete for <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>binding</term> in vivo.

Recent reports suggest that <term>PS1</term> regulates <term>cell-cell</term> <term>adhesion</term>  but the molecular basis of this regulation remains unknown (9). That <term>PS1</term> competes with <term>p120</term> for <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>binding</term> suggests that <term>PS1</term> may function as an additional regulator of the cadherin-based <term>adhesion</term> system. Indeed, in the presence of Ca2+, E-cadherin-transfected <term>PS1-/-</term> cells aggregated poorly compared with E-cadherin-transfected PS1+/+ cells, suggesting that <term>PS1</term> stimulates Ca2+-dependent <term>cell-cell</term> aggregation (Fig. 4A). Untransfected PS1+/+ cells expressing undetectable levels of <term>E-cadherin</term> showed little aggregation compared with E-cadherin-transfected PS1+/+ cells (Fig. 4A), indicating that aggregation is E-cadherin-mediated. Reintroduction of WT <term>PS1</term> into <term>PS1-/-</term> cells substantially increased Ca2+-dependent <term>cell-cell</term> aggregation (Fig. 4B). In contrast to WT <term>PS1</term> that was able to restore cadherin-dependent aggregation, <term>PS1</term> mutant DeltaE9 was inactive (Fig. 4B).

Reintroduction of WT <term>PS1</term> in <term>PS1-/-</term> cells increased the <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>complexes</term> not only with <term>PS1</term> (Fig. 3E, Right), but also with both beta- and gamma-catenin (Fig. 5 C and D, respectively). Interestingly, in contrast to WT <term>PS1</term>  FAD mutant DeltaE9 failed to stimulate <term>binding</term> of gamma-catenin to <term>E-cadherin</term> (Fig. 5D) and was less effective than the WT <term>PS1</term> in stimulating the E-cadherin/beta-catenin <term>complex</term> (Fig. 5C).

Stable cadherin-dependent <term>cell-cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> in intact cells requires linkage of the cadherin/beta- and gamma-catenin <term>complexes</term> to the actin cytoskeleton (12, 13, 23). This linkage is mediated by alpha-catenin (25) and is manifested by an increased insolubility of the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complex</term> components in <term>Triton</term> X-100 (23). Examination of <term>E-cadherin</term> and alpha-catenin <term>IPs</term> prepared from PS1+/+ and <term>PS1-/-</term> fibroblasts showed that the former cells contained higher levels of the E-cadherin/alpha-catenin <term>complexes</term> than the latter cells (Fig. 5 A and B), suggesting that <term>PS1</term> may ultimately stimulate the cytoskeletal association of the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>adhesion</term> complexes. Indeed, Fig. 6A shows that in PS1+/+ cells a significantly higher fraction of total gamma-catenin was found in the <term>Triton</term> X-100-insoluble fraction compared with <term>PS1-/-</term> cells, where almost all of the gamma-catenin was found in the <term>Triton</term> X-100-soluble fraction. <term>E-cadherin</term> also showed an increased distribution in the <term>Triton</term> X-100-insoluble fraction in PS1+/+ cells compared with <term>PS1-/-</term> cells, suggesting an increased cytoskeletal association (Fig. 6A). Similar results were obtained for beta-catenin (data not shown). <term>PS1</term> transfection of <term>PS1-/-</term> cells stimulated the cytoskeletal association of <term>E-cadherin</term>  beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, whereas transfection with the FAD DeltaE9 did not (Fig. 6B), in agreement with the inability of this FAD mutant to stabilize the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complexes</term> and to stimulate <term>cell-cell</term> adhesion.

Discussion        Top Abstract Introduction Materials and       Methods Results       Discussion References Cadherin-based <term>cell-cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> and communication are critical determinants of tissue development, function, and homeostasis (10, 11). The present study shows that <term>PS1</term> <term>binds</term> directly to E-cadherin. Remarkably, this <term>binding</term> requires mature <term>E-cadherin</term> amino acids 604-615, which are also required for <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>binding</term> of <term>p120</term>  a regulator of cadherin-mediated <term>cell-cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> (21, 24). <term>PS1</term> displaces <term>p120</term> from <term>E-cadherin</term>  stabilizes the <term>binding</term> of beta- and gamma-catenins to <term>E-cadherin</term>  increases linkage of the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complex</term> to the cytoskeleton, and stimulates Ca2+- and cadherin-dependent <term>cell-cell</term> aggregation. These findings show that <term>PS1</term> regulates the molecular composition and function of the cadherin-based <term>adhesion</term> system and suggest a possible mechanism for PS1-induced stabilization of the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complex</term> (Fig. 7). <term>PS1/CTF</term> <term>sequence</term> 340-375 <term>binds</term> <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>sequence</term> 604-615 and may tether the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic <term>E-cadherin</term> close to the plasma membrane. At a more distal site on <term>E-cadherin</term> are bound beta- or gamma-catenin (16, 17), which in turn may bind <term>PS1</term> (19, 20). These interactions could result in the formation of a stable three-member <term>complex</term>  each member of which <term>binds</term> directly to the other two. beta-Catenin or gamma-catenin <term>binds</term> alpha-catenin, which in turn anchors the <term>complexes</term> to the cytoskeleton, consistent with the increased cytoskeletal association of <term>E-cadherin</term>  beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin induced by PS1.

For more details see text.             Cadherins are expressed in specific patterns throughout the embryonic and adult life of vertebrates. At least 15 different classic cadherins have been detected in the central nervous system, where they function as guidance molecules in neurite target recognition and synapse formation and regulate synaptic plasticity (10, 11, 26, 27). The cadherin region critical for <term>PS1</term> <term>binding</term> is conserved in classic cadherins including E-, N-, P- (placental), R- (retinal), and vascular endothelial cadherin (18). This region is crucial for cell <term>adhesion</term> during embryogenesis (28), for N-cadherin-mediated neurite outgrowth (29), cell motility (30), and regulation of N- and vascular endothelial-cadherin expression in endothelial cell junctions (31). Thus <term>PS1</term> may regulate the function of multiple cadherin systems during development and adult life. That <term>PS1</term> is important for central nervous system development is suggested by <term>PS1</term> null mice that die shortly after birth with severe abnormalities of CNS development and impaired vascular integrity (7). Members of the cadherin <term>adhesion</term> <term>complex</term>  including <term>E-cadherin</term>  beta-catenin, and <term>p120</term>  have been identified as important oncogenes (15, 18, 32). That <term>PS1</term> regulates their association suggests that <term>PS1</term> itself might be involved in cancer development. <term>E-cadherin</term> is the main <term>adhesion</term> molecule of epithelia, and dysfunction of <term>E-cadherin</term> <term>complexes</term> has been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis of human epithelial cancer (32). That <term>PS1</term> promotes cadherin <term>adhesion</term> raises the possibility that loss of <term>PS1</term> function might decrease <term>cell-cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> and promote cancer development. This model suggests an explanation for the surprising observation that <term>PS1</term> down-regulation leads to the formation of epidermal tumors in adult mice (33). It is of great interest that in contrast to WT <term>PS1</term>  <term>PS1</term> FAD mutant DeltaE9 failed to increase <term>cell-cell</term> aggregation and stimulated neither formation of <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complexes</term> nor the cytoskeletal association of cadherin and catenins. This mutant lacks the <term>PS1</term> cleavage site and is not cleaved intracellularly (3, 4). Thus, the inability of this mutant to stimulate <term>cell-cell</term> <term>adhesion</term> may be due to a lack of functional <term>PS1</term> fragments. We observed that uncleaved DeltaE9 mutant forms <term>complexes</term> with <term>E-cadherin</term> (S.E. and N.K.R., unpublished observations), suggesting that incorporation of uncleaved <term>PS1</term> into the <term>cadherin/catenin</term> <term>complex</term> cannot substitute functionally for the <term>PS1</term> fragments. It remains an interesting question whether the lack of function of mutant DeltaE9 contributes to the development of the FAD phenotype. Recent evidence shows that <term>PS1</term> forms <term>complexes</term> with APP and Notch-1 receptor and regulates production of Abeta (5, 6). Like <term>E-cadherin</term>  APP and Notch-1 are type I transmembrane proteins, but the mechanism(s) involved in the <term>PS1</term> <term>binding</term> to APP and Notch-1 receptor is still not clear. Our findings on the <term>sequence</term> involved in E-cadherin/PS1 <term>binding</term> suggest a model for <term>PS1</term> <term>binding</term> to APP and Notch-1 receptors. In addition, cadherin is involved in cell <term>adhesion</term> and signaling, and APP may have similar functions (34, 35). That <term>PS1</term> forms <term>complexes</term> with the APP, Notch-1, and <term>E-cadherin</term> systems suggests that in addition to APP processing, <term>PS1</term> FAD mutations may target other type I transmembrane protein systems, including Notch-1 and cadherins. That <term>PS1</term> FAD mutants may affect an array of protein systems is in agreement with evidence that Alzheimer's disease is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple systems affected (36, 37).
