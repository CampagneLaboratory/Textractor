Proteomic Strategies to Reveal Tumor Heterogeneity among Urothelial Papillomas <A NAME="RFN4"></A><SUP><A HREF="#FN4">*</A></SUP>
</H2>

Proteomics and immunohistochemistry were used to reveal tumor<SUP> </SUP>heterogeneity among urothelial papillomas (UPs) with the long<SUP> </SUP>term goal of predicting their biological potential in terms<SUP> </SUP>of outcome. First, we identified proteins that were deregulated<SUP> </SUP>in invasive fresh lesions as compared with normal urothelium,<SUP> </SUP>and thereafter we immunostained UPs with a panel of antibodies<SUP> </SUP>against some of the markers. Twenty-two major proteins showing<SUP> </SUP>variations of 2-fold or more in at least one-third of the invasive<SUP> </SUP>lesions were selected. Specific antibodies against several of<SUP> </SUP>the proteins were obtained, but only a few reacted positively<SUP> </SUP>in immunostaining. A panel consisting of antibodies against<SUP> </SUP>keratinocytes (CKs) 5, 13, 18, and 20 and markers of squamous<SUP> </SUP>metaplasia (CKs 7, 8, and 14) was used to probe normal urothelium<SUP> </SUP>and 30 UPs collected during a period of five years. Four UPs<SUP> </SUP>showed a normal phenotype, whereas the rest could be grouped<SUP> </SUP>in five major types that shared aberrant staining with the CK20<SUP> </SUP>antibody. Type 1 heterogeneity (<I>n</I> = 4) showed preferred staining<SUP> </SUP>of the umbrella cells with the CK8 antibody. Type 2 (<I>n</I> = 11)<SUP> </SUP>was typified by the staining of the basal and intermediate layers<SUP> </SUP>with the CK20 antibody. Type 3 (<I>n</I> = 7) was characterized by<SUP> </SUP>the predominant staining of the basal cell layer with the CK5<SUP> </SUP>antibody. Type 4 (<I>n</I> = 1) showed areas of CK7 negative cells,<SUP> </SUP>whereas type 5 (<I>n</I> = 3) showed loss of staining of the basal<SUP> </SUP>cells with the CK20. 29% of the patients experienced recurrences,<SUP> </SUP>but none progressed to invasive disease. Patients harboring<SUP> </SUP>phenotypic alterations in the basal cell compartment (types<SUP> </SUP>3 and 5) showed the highest number of recurrences (4/7 and 2/3,<SUP> </SUP>respectively), and all type 3 lesions progressed to a higher<SUP> </SUP>degree of dedifferentiation<I>.</I> Even though a long term prospective<SUP> </SUP>study involving a larger sample size is required to assess the<SUP> </SUP>biological potential of these lesions, we believe that this<SUP> </SUP>approach will prove instrumental for revealing early phenotypic<SUP> </SUP>changes in different types of .<SUP> </SUP><P>
