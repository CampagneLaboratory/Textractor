What does an anecdote about John Snow have to do with modern-day<SUP> </SUP>epidemiology? And why use it to introduce an issue of the <I>Journal</I><SUP> </SUP>highlighting the challenges of studying disease risks associated<SUP> </SUP>with low dose environmental exposures?<SUP> </SUP><P>

In this issue, Lilienfeld describes John Snow giving expert-witness<SUP> </SUP>testimony on behalf of industry (1<A HREF="#B1"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>). Besides being interesting<SUP> </SUP>on a historical basis, this incident raises several issues that<SUP> </SUP>are pertinent today. Lilienfeld's paper and the accompanying<SUP> </SUP>commentary by Vandenbroucke (2<A HREF="#B2"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) deal directly or indirectly<SUP> </SUP>with the role and responsibilities of expert witnesses, the<SUP> </SUP>extrapolation of data on health effects from high dose exposures<SUP> </SUP>to low dose exposures, the importance of epidemiology to the<SUP> </SUP>development of public health policy, the current debates on<SUP> </SUP>environmental justice (3<A HREF="#B3"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>), and the use of the precautionary<SUP> </SUP>principle (4<A HREF="#B4"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) in standard-setting. Furthermore, if faced with<SUP> </SUP>an issue similar to that faced by Snow&#151;namely, local residents'<SUP> </SUP>being worried about health consequences associated with emanations<SUP> </SUP>from factories&#151;would modern-day environmental epidemiologists<SUP> </SUP>be any better positioned to carry out appropriate studies and<SUP> </SUP>reach sound conclusions?<SUP> </SUP><P>

Snow can be seen at once as victim and perpetrator of sins that<SUP> </SUP>are common in epidemiology in general and in environmental epidemiology<SUP> </SUP>in particular. Was Snow victimized by the medical establishment,<SUP> </SUP>including <I>The Lancet</I>, for expressing views that were not commonly<SUP> </SUP>held by the scientists of the day? Were his peers outraged because<SUP> </SUP>of the reactionary social position he was taking (as suggested<SUP> </SUP>by Vandenbroucke)? On the other hand, was he as guilty as proponents<SUP> </SUP>of the miasma theory for trying to apply his theory of disease<SUP> </SUP>transmission to all situations without allowing for the possibility<SUP> </SUP>of multiple disease pathways? Did he fall into the trap of equating<SUP> </SUP>the absence of data with an absence of effect?<SUP> </SUP><P>

When Snow contended that emanations from the bone-boiling factories<SUP> </SUP>were not causing ill health in the community at large, he invoked<SUP> </SUP>arguments that are often raised when unexpected health effects<SUP> </SUP>are encountered following supposed low dose exposures. One argument<SUP> </SUP>is that such health effects are implausible given what we know<SUP> </SUP>about high dose exposures. In this instance, Snow noted that<SUP> </SUP>the factory workers were not dying and therefore health effects<SUP> </SUP>in the community at large were not plausible. A related argument<SUP> </SUP>is that, even if workers are dying or suffering other health<SUP> </SUP>effects, because of the distance from the exposure source, the<SUP> </SUP>exposure levels in the community are probably too low to plausibly<SUP> </SUP>affect health.<SUP> </SUP><P>

Health effects of low dose exposures are often seen as implausible,<SUP> </SUP>even in the face of accumulated consistent evidence. Such arguments<SUP> </SUP>have frequently been invoked in environmental epidemiology.<SUP> </SUP>Examples of low dose exposures that have been deemed implausible<SUP> </SUP>contributors to disease risk based on what is known about high<SUP> </SUP>dose exposures include passive smoking, residential radon exposure,<SUP> </SUP>childhood lead exposure, electromagnetic fields, and residence<SUP> </SUP>near nuclear facilities. If one begins with a fixed idea of<SUP> </SUP>what is plausible, arguments regarding susceptible subgroups,<SUP> </SUP>inverse dose rate, hormesis, multiple pathways, multifactor<SUP> </SUP>etiologies, and complex exposures (e.g., the different constituents<SUP> </SUP>of sidestream and mainstream smoke) are untenable.<SUP> </SUP><P>

But how do we know that the factory workers were not dying or<SUP> </SUP>suffering other ill effects? Snow cited no studies. All too<SUP> </SUP>often the absence of data is argued as proof of no effect. This<SUP> </SUP>issue becomes especially difficult when regulatory decisions<SUP> </SUP>are being made. In the absence of evidence, can something be<SUP> </SUP>considered safe? While science is important, it is ultimately<SUP> </SUP>social forces, as much as science, that guide regulators in<SUP> </SUP>decision-making.<SUP> </SUP><P>

Snow's statements and the questions that were put to him call<SUP> </SUP>to mind some of the fundamental difficulties inherent in environmental<SUP> </SUP>epidemiology. Today, there are numerous examples of residents<SUP> </SUP>who live near potential environmental hazards claiming health<SUP> </SUP>effects that can never be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<SUP> </SUP>Although the "gold standard" is an unbiased risk estimate with<SUP> </SUP>precise confidence limits, studies focused on overt health effects<SUP> </SUP>are invariably underpowered because of the small numbers of<SUP> </SUP>residents in the neighborhoods of interest. Other creative approaches<SUP> </SUP>to assessment of subclinical health effects are more costly<SUP> </SUP>and difficult to implement, but even these studies are often<SUP> </SUP>too small for conclusive results. Yet, what is the right thing<SUP> </SUP>to do? If we wait for strong scientific evidence before we act&#151;if<SUP> </SUP>we require proof that workers are dying or evidence of overt<SUP> </SUP>illness in the community&#151;have we waited too long? Few<SUP> </SUP>clusters are ever resolved with the identification of a causal<SUP> </SUP>link between some localized exposure and disease. While many<SUP> </SUP>apparent clusters may be artifacts, what is the real cost of<SUP> </SUP>the true hazards that cannot be proven? These were the issues<SUP> </SUP>facing Parliament when Snow testified on behalf of industry.<SUP> </SUP><P>

What is the role of the epidemiologist in this quagmire? In<SUP> </SUP>Snow's London, the living conditions of people near the factories<SUP> </SUP>were likely to have been dismal. There were no doubt residents<SUP> </SUP>who perceived their symptoms as being related to the smells&#151;smells<SUP> </SUP>that, if nothing else, impacted the quality of life. Policy-makers<SUP> </SUP>must balance "doing the right thing" with regard to human suffering<SUP> </SUP>and quality of life with the financial costs of doing so. Epidemiology<SUP> </SUP>can only go so far in providing the answers.<SUP> </SUP><P>

It is this political and social tug-of-war that makes environmental<SUP> </SUP>epidemiology especially difficult. On the one hand, there are<SUP> </SUP>well&#151;funded industries with a financial stake in the outcome<SUP> </SUP>of such research. As Vandenbroucke notes (2<A HREF="#B2"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>), these industries<SUP> </SUP>often are in a position to exploit the many weaknesses that<SUP> </SUP>epidemiologists are trained to identify in their own studies<SUP> </SUP>and in the work of others to cast potentially damaging results<SUP> </SUP>in a more favorable light. On the other hand, there are environmental<SUP> </SUP>groups committed to proving that a particular environmental<SUP> </SUP>exposure can be linked to a variety of personal complaints;<SUP> </SUP>these groups may be motivated by the possibility of effecting<SUP> </SUP>social change through science or by the prospect of receiving<SUP> </SUP>needed medical attention or financial compensation. Those who<SUP> </SUP>attempt to work in this arena often find themselves and their<SUP> </SUP>research attacked from all directions.<SUP> </SUP><P>

Environmental epidemiology is difficult to conduct today for<SUP> </SUP>other reasons as well. Adequate tools with which to measure<SUP> </SUP>and quantify exposures are lacking. Studies are often unable<SUP> </SUP>to detect meaningful effects because exposures are low, infrequent,<SUP> </SUP>or difficult to measure with certainty. How many investigators<SUP> </SUP>are willing to tackle this problem? In the case of the bone-boiling<SUP> </SUP>factories, would research linking questionnaire data on symptoms<SUP> </SUP>to factory releases be believed? Would a study relating distance<SUP> </SUP>from the factory to disease be sufficient evidence of effect?<SUP> </SUP>What health effects would be plausible based on known biologic<SUP> </SUP>mechanisms? How well could those effects be measured, and could<SUP> </SUP>they be measured objectively? Is there a biomarker of exposure?<SUP> </SUP>If a biomarker exists, does it measure relevant past exposures?<SUP> </SUP>Is the measure unaffected by current health status&#151;particularly<SUP> </SUP>the disease under study?<SUP> </SUP><P>

In addition to Lilienfeld's historical report and Vandenbroucke's<SUP> </SUP>commentary, this issue of the <I>Journal</I> features papers that illustrate<SUP> </SUP>various aspects of the difficulties faced in studying health<SUP> </SUP>effects of environmental exposures. Several of these include<SUP> </SUP>innovative attempts to improve the quality of such research.<SUP> </SUP><P>

The paper by Viel et al. (5<A HREF="#B5"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) may come closest to what many may<SUP> </SUP>think of as environmental epidemiology. The authors have examined<SUP> </SUP>the spatial distribution of soft tissue sarcomas and non-Hodgkin's<SUP> </SUP>lymphomas around an incinerator with high dioxin emissions.<SUP> </SUP>Their results are suggestive but need to be followed by studies<SUP> </SUP>incorporating more rigorous exposure assessment&#151;perhaps<SUP> </SUP>a biologic measure of exposure such as that used in the study<SUP> </SUP>of polychlorinated biphenyls and breast cancer reported by Zheng<SUP> </SUP>et al. (6<A HREF="#B6"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>). Other studies described in this issue used a variety<SUP> </SUP>of approaches to exposure assessment. Rondeau et al. (7<A HREF="#B7"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) linked<SUP> </SUP>estimates of levels of aluminum and silica in drinking water<SUP> </SUP>to risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Laden et al. (8<A HREF="#B8"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>)<SUP> </SUP>used questionnaire data on use of electric blankets to estimate<SUP> </SUP>exposure to electromagnetic fields, and Gustavsson et al. (9<A HREF="#B9"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>)<SUP> </SUP>used questionnaire data and expert assessment by industrial<SUP> </SUP>hygienists to classify environmental and occupational exposures.<SUP> </SUP>Radiation workers are one of the few groups for which historical<SUP> </SUP>records of personal exposure typically are available. Dupree-Ellis<SUP> </SUP>et al. (10<A HREF="#B10"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) took advantage of such records to estimate cumulative<SUP> </SUP>external radiation exposure.<SUP> </SUP><P>

Several of the papers evaluate methods for assessing exposure.<SUP> </SUP>For example, Oglesby et al. (11<A HREF="#B11"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) average individual-level annoyance<SUP> </SUP>scores to estimate community-level exposure to air pollution.<SUP> </SUP>The authors propose that this measure better accounts for exposure<SUP> </SUP>variability than data from fixed-site monitoring stations. This<SUP> </SUP>is an interesting twist in a field where much work is based<SUP> </SUP>on linking data from monitoring stations with population-level<SUP> </SUP>mortality statistics. The measure seems to be easy to operationalize,<SUP> </SUP>and it correlates well with monitoring station data, although<SUP> </SUP>its ultimate utility may be limited. The real gold standard&#151;a<SUP> </SUP>more precise direct measure of individual exposure, rather than<SUP> </SUP>another indirect measure&#151;is what is needed. Hwang et al.<SUP> </SUP>(12<A HREF="#B12"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) propose an alternative modeling approach whereby air pollution<SUP> </SUP>monitoring station data are used to ascribe exposures to individuals<SUP> </SUP>with and without school absences due to respiratory disease.<SUP> </SUP>Auvinen et al. (13<A HREF="#B13"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) compare several possible methods for measuring<SUP> </SUP>and classifying exposure to electromagnetic fields. This is<SUP> </SUP>a topic that has been hurt by the lack of consensus on the best<SUP> </SUP>and most appropriate exposure measure, and results tend to vary<SUP> </SUP>for studies employing different exposure metrics. The paper<SUP> </SUP>by Karagas et al. (14<A HREF="#B14"><IMG BORDER=1 WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALT="Go"
SRC="/icons/fig-down.gif"></A>) attempts to link a biologic measure,<SUP> </SUP>arsenic in toenails, with an environmental measure of arsenic<SUP> </SUP>in water. The toenail measure is likely to reflect total body<SUP> </SUP>burden, but it appears to correlate with water only when water<SUP> </SUP>levels are high. This presents an interesting regulatory dilemma.<SUP> </SUP>The best epidemiologic research may be based on a direct measure<SUP> </SUP>of body burden such as levels in toenails, whereas it is water<SUP> </SUP>levels that need to be regulated. Studies of toenail arsenic<SUP> </SUP>levels may not shed direct light on the link between water levels<SUP> </SUP>and disease.<SUP> </SUP><P>

As these papers demonstrate, technological advances are making<SUP> </SUP>possible a wide range of new study designs and strategies to<SUP> </SUP>better assess both exposures and outcomes. Although progress<SUP> </SUP>has been made, research in environmental epidemiology is far<SUP> </SUP>from perfect. As epidemiologists face pressures and criticisms<SUP> </SUP>from industry, regulatory bodies, and other scientific disciplines,<SUP> </SUP>it is important to not lose sight of the lessons from John Snow.<SUP> </SUP><P>
