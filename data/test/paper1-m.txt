To analyze whether a <term>neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> response which developed earlier could contribute to <term>LCMV</term> clearance during the acute phase of <term>infection</term>  we generated <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> expressing <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> antibodies.

Thus, early-inducible <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> can contribute to viral clearance in the acute phase of the <term>infection</term> and do not cause antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.          INTRODUCTION       Top        Abstract        Introduction        Materials & Methods        Results        Discussion        References Against many cytopathic viruses such as poliovirus, influenza <term>virus</term>  rabies <term>virus</term>  and vesicular stomatitis <term>virus</term>  protective virus-neutralizing <term>antibodies</term> are generated early, within 1 week <term>after</term> <term>infection</term> (3, 31, 36, 44, 49). In contrast, several noncytopathic viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency <term>virus</term> and hepatitis viruses B and C in humans or <term>lymphocytic</term> <term>choriomeningitis</term> <term>virus</term>  <term>LCMV</term>  in <term>mice</term>  elicit poor and delayed virus-neutralizing <term>antibody</term> responses (1, 7, 20, 24, 27, 35, 45, 48). In the mouse, the natural host of <term>LCMV</term>  the acute <term>LCMV</term> <term>infection</term> is predominantly controlled by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in an obligatory perforin-dependent manner (13, 18, 28, 50). In addition to the <term>CTL</term> response, LCMV-specific <term>antibodies</term> are generated. Early <term>after</term> <term>infection</term> (by day 8), a strong <term>antibody</term> response specific for the internal viral nucleoprotein (NP) is mounted (7, 19, 23, 28). These early <term>LCMV</term> NP-specific <term>antibodies</term> exhibit no virus-neutralizing capacity (7, 10). Results from studies of B-cell-depleted <term>mice</term> and B-cell-deficient <term>mice</term> implied that the early <term>LCMV</term> NP-specific <term>antibodies</term> are not involved in the clearance of <term>LCMV</term> (8, 11, 12, 40). Late <term>after</term> <term>infection</term> (between days 30 and day 60), <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> develop (7, 19, 22, 28, 33); these <term>antibodies</term> are directed against the surface glycoprotein (GP) of <term>LCMV</term> (9, 10). <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> have an important function in protection against reinfection (4, 6, 38, 41, 47). In some viral infections, subprotective virus-neutralizing <term>antibody</term> <term>titers</term> can enhance disease rather than promote host recovery (i.e., exhibit antibody-dependent enhancement of disease [ADE] [14, 15, 21, 46]). For example, <term>neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> are involved in the resolution of a primary dengue <term>virus</term> <term>infection</term> and in the protection against reinfection. However, if subprotective <term>neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> <term>titers</term> are present at the time of reinfection, a severe form of the disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome [15, 21]), which might be caused by <term>F.</term> receptor-mediated uptake of virus-antibody complexes leading to an enhanced <term>infection</term> of monocytes (15, 16, 25, 39), can develop. Similarly, an enhancement of disease <term>after</term> intracerebral  <term>i.c.</term>  <term>LCMV</term> <term>infection</term> was observed in <term>mice</term> which had been treated with virus-neutralizing <term>antibodies</term> before the <term>virus</term> challenge (6). ADE in LCMV-infected <term>mice</term> was either due to an enhanced <term>infection</term> of monocytes by <term>F.</term> receptor-mediated uptake of antibody-virus complexes or due to CTL-mediated immunopathology caused by an imbalanced <term>virus</term> spread and <term>CTL</term> response. To analyze whether <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> generated early <term>after</term> <term>infection</term> improve the host's capacity to clear the <term>virus</term> or enhance immunopathological disease, immunoglobulin (Ig)-transgenic <term>mice</term> expressing <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>IgM</term> <term>antibodies</term> were generated. After <term>LCMV</term> <term>infection</term> of <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> expressing the Ig heavy chain  <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> , <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> serum <term>antibodies</term> were mounted within 8 days, which significantly improved the host's capacity to eliminate LCMV. <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> did not show any signs of ADE <term>after</term> <term>i.c.</term> <term>LCMV</term> infection. Transgenic <term>mice</term> expressing the Ig heavy and light chains  <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term>  exhibited spontaneous <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> serum <term>antibodies</term> and confirmed the protective role of preexisting <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term>  even though the <term>neutralizing</term> serum <term>antibodies</term> were of the <term>IgM</term> isotype. Similar to <term>mice</term> which had been treated with <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term>  <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> developed an enhanced disease <term>after</term> <term>i.c.</term> <term>LCMV</term> <term>infection</term>  which indicated that ADE was due to an imbalance between <term>virus</term> spread and <term>CTL</term> response. Thus, the early-inducible <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> response significantly enhanced clearance of the acute <term>infection</term> without any risk of causing ADE.          MATERIALS AND METHODS       Top        Abstract        Introduction        Materials & Methods        Results        Discussion        References Generation of <term>transgenic</term> mice. Gene segments coding for the Ig heavy-chain V (VH) region and Ig light-chain V (VL) region were cloned from the B-cell hybridoma KL25 (9), which neutralized the <term>LCMV</term> isolate WE. The VH segment contained the autologous promoter, the rearranged VDJ region, and the heavy-chain intron enhancer. It was isolated from a  ZAP library (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) generated from EcoRI-digested KL25 genomic DNA by using an intron enhancer-specific probe. The EcoRI fragment containing the VH region was ligated into the EcoRI site of a transgene expression vector encoding the genomic Cµ region of mouse <term>IgM</term> allotype a (Cµa) (30). The VL region of KL25 was PCR amplified from KL25 genomic DNA by using a V4-specific primer (5'- AAA AGA GCT CAA AAT GGA TTT TCA AGT GCA GAT TTT -3', annealing at the first 23 nucleotides of the V4 leader and introducing a SacI site 5' of amino acid position 22) and a J4-specific primer (5'- TAT ACT TAC GTT TTA TTT CCA ACT TTG TCC CCG -3', annealing at the 3' end of the J4 segment including the sequence of the splice donor signal). The resulting PCR product containing the light-chain leader, the intron, and the rearranged VJ region of the light chain (VL) was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript. After verification of the sequence of the PCR-derived fragment by automated DNA sequencing (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.), the SacI/HindIII fragment containing the VL gene was ligated into the SacI/HindIII sites of a C expression vector encoding the mouse  light-chain C (C) region (42). To prepare DNA for microinjection, the µ heavy-chain transgene was excised by using restriction endonucleases AatII and XhoI, and the  light-chain transgene was linearized at the unique XbaI site. The two transgene constructs were coinjected into male pronuclei of fertilized oocytes of the mouse strain C57BL/6 LTK. Transgene integrations were screened by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Inbred C57BL/6 (H-2b) <term>mice</term> from the breeding colony of the Institut für Zuchthygiene, Tierspital Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland, were used as donors for fertilized oocytes. Virus. LCMV-WE was originally provided by <term>F.</term> Lehmann-Grube, Hamburg, Germany, and was grown on L-929 cells for 48 h in minimal essential medium-5% fetal calf serum <term>after</term> <term>infection</term> with an initial multiplicity of <term>infection</term> of 0.01. FACS analysis. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, Calif.) according to standard procedures. The following <term>antibodies</term> were used: rat anti-mouse CD45R (B220)-phycoerythrin conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and mouse anti-mouse IgMa (the constant domain of mouse <term>IgM</term> allotype a [30])-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (PharMingen, San Diego, Calif.). Living cells were gated by using a combination of forward scatter and 90° side scatter. <term>LCMV</term> infectious focus formation assay. Viral <term>titers</term> from spleens of infected <term>mice</term> were determined as described previously (5). Briefly, spleen homogenates were serially diluted 10-fold and grown on an MC57G cell monolayer for 48 h under an overlay of 1% methylcellulose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were fixed with 4% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline, and infectious foci were detected by intracellular <term>LCMV</term> staining of infected cells with the rat anti-LCMV monoclonal <term>antibody</term> (MAb) VL-4 (5). <term>LCMV</term> neutralization in vitro: infectious focus reduction assay. <term>LCMV</term> neutralization in vitro was determined with an infectious focus reduction assay as described previously (5). Briefly, serial 2-fold dilutions of 10-fold-prediluted sera were incubated with <term>LCMV</term> for 90 min at 37°C in a 96-well plate. MC57G mouse fibroblasts were added, and <term>after</term> approximately 4 h, when the cells had settled and had absorbed the nonneutralized <term>virus</term>  cells were overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; 48 h later, cell monolayers were fixed with 4% formalin and remaining infectious foci were detected as in the focus formation assay by intracellular <term>LCMV</term> staining of infected cells with the rat anti-LCMV MAb VL-4. Sera were tested under nonreducing conditions to measure neutralization by total Ig. To obtain values for IgG, sera were reduced prior to the neutralization assay by adding 2-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 0.05 M for 90 min at room temperature. Sera were heat inactivated at 56°C for 60 min. Cytotoxicity assay. The cytolytic activity of spleen cells was tested in a 51Cr release assay as described previously (50). Briefly, MC57G target cells were coated with LCMV-derived peptide GP33-41 (32) or NP396-408 (37) or with an H-2Db-binding adenovirus peptide (26) as a negative control at concentrations of 106 M; 104 target cells were incubated in 96-well round-bottom plates with serial threefold dilutions of spleen effector cells starting at an effector-to-target ratio of 70:1 in a final volume of 200 µl. After 5 h of incubation at 37°C, 70 µl of supernatant was harvested and  irradiation was measured.

The VH and VL gene segments of the B-cell hybridoma KL25 (9) secreting an <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> MAb were cloned and ligated into transgene expression vectors encoding IgMa and C (42), respectively (Fig. 1). Both constructs were microinjected into C57BL/6 oocytes. Integration and germ line transmission of the transgenes were monitored by PCR and Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Multiple transgene integrations in one founder led to the establishment of two independent <term>transgenic</term> mouse lines: the <term>transgenic</term> mouse line <term>H25</term> expressed the <term>transgenic</term> heavy chain, whereas the <term>transgenic</term> mouse line <term>HL25</term> expressed both the <term>transgenic</term> heavy and light chains.

The             heavy- and light-chain constructs were linearized prior to             microinjection by using restriction endonucleases AatII and XhoI             (heavy chain) and XbaI (light chain). IE, Ig heavy-chain intron             enhancer; P, autologous promoter of the cloned VH gene segment; P,             consensus  light-chain promoter. Expression of the <term>transgenic</term> IgMa heavy chain on the surface of B220-positive B cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen cells, and bone marrow cells of <term>H25</term> and <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> was determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 2). The proportion of cells expressing the surface IgMa was lower in <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> than in <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> mice. This might be due either to the coexpression of the optimally fitting transgenes encoding the heavy and the light chains in <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> or to different genomic integration sites of the heavy-chain transgenes in the two different <term>transgenic</term> mouse lines.

In contrast, the spontaneous <term>neutralizing</term> <term>titers</term> of <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> did not change <term>after</term> infection. Sera of nontransgenic control <term>mice</term> did not show any <term>neutralizing</term> activity within the observation period of 50 days (Fig. 3C). The <term>neutralizing</term> capacity of all sera was abolished when tested under reducing conditions, indicating that the <term>virus</term> neutralization was mediated by <term>IgM</term> <term>antibodies</term> presumably encoded by the transgenes.

At             days 1 to 10, spleens were tested for <term>virus</term> <term>titers</term> in an infectious             focus formation assay. Virus <term>titers</term> per spleen of individual <term>mice</term>             are indicated. The log titer of 1.7 is the detection limit of the             assay. Values are for individual <term>mice</term> from one representative             experiment of three similar experiments.

To analyze whether the enhanced <term>LCMV</term> elimination was due to the early <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> response or due to an enhanced <term>CTL</term> activity, <term>H25</term> and <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> and transgene-negative littermates were infected i.v. with 200 PFU of LCMV-WE.

This finding indicated that the complete antiviral protection in <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> and the enhanced clearance of <term>LCMV</term> in <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> were mediated by the transgene-encoded <term>antibodies</term> and were not due to an enhanced <term>CTL</term> activity.

However, they survived a high-dose (105-PFU) <term>i.c.</term> <term>infection</term> because LCMV-specific CTLs were exhausted (17, 29) (Fig. 6A). If 200 µg of the <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> IgG1 MAb KL25 was administered intraperitoneally 4 h before <term>i.c.</term> <term>virus</term> challenge, <term>mice</term> died <term>after</term> low and high doses of <term>infection</term> (6) (Fig. 6B). To test whether such an ADE <term>after</term> high-dose <term>i.c.</term> <term>infection</term> also occurred in <term>H25</term> and <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term>  Ig-transgenic <term>mice</term> were infected <term>i.c.</term> with low- or high-dose LCMV-WE. As expected, the majority of <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> infected <term>i.c.</term> with low-dose LCMV-WE died. However, all <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> infected <term>i.c.</term> with high-dose LCMV-WE survived, indicating the absence of ADE (Fig. 6C). In contrast, 100 and 60% of <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> infected <term>i.c.</term> with low-dose or high-dose LCMV-WE, respectively, died, indicating the presence of ADE (Fig. 6D). Thus, ADE was observed in <term>mice</term> treated with MAb KL25 and in <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> exhibiting spontaneous <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> titers. In constrast, ADE was absent in normal <term>mice</term> which do not generate <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> before day 30 and in <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> which mount an inducible <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> response <term>after</term> <term>i.c.</term> <term>infection</term> by day 8, similar to what was observed <term>after</term> i.v. <term>infection</term> (data not shown). Since <term>after</term> <term>LCMV</term> <term>infection</term> <term>neutralizing</term> <term>IgM</term> <term>antibodies</term> are observed in <term>H25</term> and <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term>  enhancement of disease via binding to polymeric <term>F.</term> receptor (2, 34, 43) should have occurred in both Ig-transgenic mice. Therefore, our results indicate that ADE of <term>lymphocytic</term> <term>choriomeningitis</term> presumably is caused by an antibody-influenced shift of the balance between <term>virus</term> spread and the <term>CTL</term> response.

DISCUSSION       Top        Abstract        Introduction        Materials & Methods        Results        Discussion        References In this present study, we cloned the gene segments encoding the VH and VL regions of the <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> MAb KL25 and expressed them as µ heavy and  light chains in <term>transgenic</term> mice. We established two independent mouse lines expressing the <term>transgenic</term> heavy chain  <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term>  or both the <term>transgenic</term> heavy and light chains  <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> . <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> developed <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>IgM</term> serum <term>titers</term> early <term>after</term> <term>infection</term>  which augmented elimination of the virus. These experiments demonstrated that early-inducible <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> <term>titers</term> supported the control of a noncytopathic <term>virus</term> during the acute phase of the <term>infection</term> and indicated a potentially important role of <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> in clearance of the virus. The <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> exhibited spontaneous <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> serum <term>titers</term> which protected against i.v. <term>infection</term>  even though the transgene-encoded <term>antibodies</term> were of the <term>IgM</term> isotype. This finding is in accordance with previous reports showing the protective capacity of passively administered IgG <term>antibodies</term> (4, 6, 38, 41, 47). The enhanced capacity of the <term>H25</term> and <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> to eliminate <term>LCMV</term> was not due to an enhanced <term>CTL</term> activity. Ex vivo <term>CTL</term> activity was always lower in <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> than in transgene-negative littermates and was below detection limits in <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> mice. Obviously, the early-developing <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> in <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> allowed an almost normal priming of CTLs, whereas the spontaneous <term>titers</term> of <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> in <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> neutralized <term>LCMV</term> quantitatively and prevented induction of CTLs. Therefore, the improvement of <term>LCMV</term> clearance in <term>H25</term> and <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> was mediated by the transgene-encoded antibodies. Earlier studies suggested some role of the antibody-Fc part for in vivo protection, since <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> MAbs of the IgG2a isotype protected from lethal <term>lymphocytic</term> <term>choriomeningitis</term>  whereas MAbs of the IgG1 isotype did not (4). This was further supported by the finding that the F(ab')2 fragment generated proteolytically from one protective IgG2a MAb did not protect (4). The <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> MAb KL25, which is of the IgG1 subclass, was protective against i.v. <term>LCMV</term> <term>infection</term> in an in vivo passive immunization experiment (38). After transferring the <term>LCMV</term> GP1 specificity of MAb KL25 to the <term>IgM</term> isotype, the <term>transgenic</term> <term>IgM</term> retained the in vitro <term>neutralizing</term> capacity and was protective in vivo. These results indicated that the isotype dependence of in vivo antiviral protection against <term>LCMV</term> <term>infection</term> is related to the <term>antibody</term> specificity analyzed. Mice passively immunized with <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> showed ADE of <term>choriomeningitis</term> <term>after</term> <term>i.c.</term> <term>infection</term> with a high dose (105 PFU) of LCMV-WE (6). This was due either to enhanced <term>infection</term> of monocytes with virus-antibody complexes via their <term>F.</term> receptors or to an antibody-mediated shift of the balance between <term>virus</term> spread and the <term>CTL</term> response leading to CTL-mediated immunopathology (6). In our experiments, the transferred MAb KL25 and the preexisting <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> in <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> led to ADE <term>after</term> high-dose <term>i.c.</term> <term>infection</term>  whereas the inducible <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> in <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> did not. Since <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>IgM</term> <term>antibodies</term> are generated <term>after</term> <term>infection</term> of <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term>  an enhanced <term>infection</term> of monocytes should have occurred in <term>H25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> as well as in <term>HL25</term> <term>transgenic</term> <term>mice</term> via the binding to the polymeric <term>F.</term> receptor (2, 34, 43). Obviously, the inducible virus-neutralizing serum <term>antibodies</term> are generated too late to influence the balance between <term>virus</term> spread and <term>CTL</term> response. Therefore, ADE of <term>lymphocytic</term> <term>choriomeningitis</term> presumably is due to an imbalance between <term>virus</term> spread and <term>CTL</term> response mediated by preexisting <term>neutralizing</term> <term>antibody</term> titers. In conclusion, we demonstrated that early-generated <term>LCMV-neutralizing</term> <term>antibodies</term> enhanced clearance of <term>LCMV</term> <term>after</term> i.v. <term>infection</term> without the risk for ADE <term>after</term> <term>i.c.</term> infection. Therefore, vaccination strategies accelerating virus-neutralizing <term>antibody</term> responses may enhance clearance of noncytopathic viruses without the risk of causing ADE.
