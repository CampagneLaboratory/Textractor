Here we show that presenilin-1  <b>PS1</b> , a protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease, controls a -secretase-like <b>cleavage</b> of E-cadherin. This <b>cleavage</b> is stimulated by apoptosis or calcium influx and occurs between human <b>E-cadherin</b> residues Leu731 and Arg732 at the membrane–cytoplasm interface. The <b>PS1/-secretase</b> system cleaves both the full-length <b>E-cadherin</b> and a transmembrane C-terminal fragment, derived from a metalloproteinase <b>cleavage</b> after the <b>E-cadherin</b> ectodomain residue Pro700. The <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> dissociates E-cadherins, <b>ß-catenin</b> and -catenin from the cytoskeleton, thus promoting disassembly of the E-cadherin–catenin <b>adhesion</b> complex. Furthermore, this <b>cleavage</b> releases the cytoplasmic <b>E-cadherin</b> to the cytosol and increases the levels of soluble ß- and -catenins. Thus, the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> system stimulates disassembly of the E-cadherin– catenin complex and increases the cytosolic pool of <b>ß-catenin</b>  a key regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway.

In addition, cadherins play important roles in cell signaling, proliferation and differentiation (Steinberg and McNutt, 1999; Tepass <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000). In cadherin-based adherens junctions (CAJs), the extracellular domains of transmembrane cadherins promote <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> by engaging in Ca2+-dependent homophilic interactions, while the cytoplasmic domains are linked to the actin cytoskeleton via - and ß-catenins (Steinberg and McNutt, 1999; Gumbiner, 2000). Post-translational regulation of cadherin adhesive activities, including proteolytic processing of cadherins and disassembly of CAJs, plays crucial roles in rapid changes in cell <b>adhesion</b>  signaling and apoptosis (Herren <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1998; Gumbiner, 2000; Vallorosi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000; Steinhusen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> , but the molecular mechanisms involved in cadherin processing and CAJ disassembly remain mostly unknown. <b>PS1</b> is a polytopic transmembrane protein involved in most cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD). Cellular <b>PS1</b> is cleaved to yield an N-terminal (PS1/NTF) and a C-terminal (PS1/CTF) fragment. Following <b>cleavage</b>  the resultant <b>PS1</b> fragments form a stable 1:1 heterodimer (Thinakaran <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1996; Podlisny <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1997) that binds to the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of <b>E-cadherin</b> (Baki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . <b>PS1</b> is found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–Golgi system and the neuronal somatodendritic compartment (Cook <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1996; Elder <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1996; Kovacs <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1996), but upon formation of <b>cell–cell</b> contacts <b>PS1</b> concentrates at intercellular sites at the cell surface where it forms complexes with the CAJ (Georgakopoulos <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999). In addition to <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>PS1</b> forms complexes with N-cadherin and it has been localized at synaptic sites (Georgakopoulos <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999). Recently it was reported that <b>PS1</b> regulates a <b>-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of both APP and Notch receptor and stimulates Aß production (De Strooper <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999; Selkoe, <b>2001</b> . Here we show that apoptosis or Ca2+ influx stimulates a <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of E-cadherin. This <b>cleavage</b> results in the release of the cytoplasmic sequence of <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>ß-catenin</b> and -catenin to the soluble cytosol, thus facilitating disassembly of CAJs. In contrast to APP and Notch, however, both of which are cleaved within their transmembrane sequence (Schroeter <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1998; Gu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2001; Sastre <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2001; Yu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> , the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> takes place at the membrane–cytosol interface.          Results       Top      Abstract      Introduction      Results      Discussion      Materials and methods      Acknowledgements      References A <b>PS1/-secretase</b> activity controls <b>E-cadherin</b> processingWe used extracts from <b>PS1</b> knock-out mouse embryos (PS1–/–) (Baki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b>  to investigate whether <b>PS1</b> plays any role in <b>E-cadherin</b> processing. PS1–/– embryos had significantly higher amounts of a 38 kDa peptide that contained the cytoplasmic sequence of <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  than did wild-type (PS1+/+) embryos, even though <b>al.</b> embryos had similar levels of the full-length <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>Figure</b> 1A, upper panel). As expected (De Strooper <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999), PS1–/– embryos also contained increased levels of APP -stubs  <b>Figure</b> 1A, middle panels). <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> accumulates in a fibroblast cell line that was derived from PS1–/– mice (Baki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b>  compared with a cell line from PS1+/+ mice, even though both cell lines express comparable amounts of transfected full-length <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>Figure</b> 1B). The accumulation of <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> in PS1–/– cells under conditions of constant levels of the full-length protein suggests that a PS1-mediated activity may control metabolism of E-Cad/CTF1. Indeed, treatment of E-cadherin-transfected PS1+/+ fibroblasts with the selective <b>-secretase</b> inhibitor L-685,458 (Li <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000; Shearman <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000) increased cellular <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> compared with non-treated controls  <b>Figure</b> 1C), indicating that the PS1-associated <b>-secretase</b> activity (Esler and Wolfe, <b>2001</b>  may be involved in the metabolism of E-Cad/CTF1.

(B) Extracts from E-cadherin-transfected PS1+/+ or PS1–/–             mouse fibroblasts were probed with anti-E-cadherin C36 (upper panel)             or 33B10 (lower panel) antibodies. (C) PS1+/+ fibroblasts were             treated for 6 h either with the <b>-secretase</b> inhibitor L-685,458 (0.5             µM) or with dimethylsulfoxide. Extracts from these cell cultures             were then probed with anti-E-cadherin C36. The asterisk indicates a             non-specific band. Although our data suggested that peptide <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> is processed further by a PS1/-secretase-dependent <b>cleavage</b>  we were unable to detect any <b>E-cadherin</b> metabolites resulting from this activity either in embryos or in PS1+/+ fibroblasts. The apparent molecular weight and immunoreactivity of <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  however, suggested that this fragment derives from a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) <b>cleavage</b> of the <b>E-cadherin</b> ectodomain. Since this <b>cleavage</b> is stimulated by apoptosis (Steinhusen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> , we asked whether the levels of the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> product of <b>E-cadherin</b> might increase in apoptotic conditions. Human epithelial cell line A431 that expresses high levels of endogenous <b>E-cadherin</b> and undergoes apoptosis under staurosporine (STS) treatment (Steinhusen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b>  was used as a model. STS treatment of this cell line resulted in a time-dependent production of three <b>E-cadherin</b> C-terminal fragments migrating at 38, 33 and 29 kDa, respectively  <b>Figure</b> 2A). Production of the 38 kDa fragment is inhibited by the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (Galardy <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1994), indicating that this fragment, which has immunoreactivity and apparent molecular mass identical to <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  <b>Figure</b> 1), is derived from an MMP <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>Figure</b> 2B, middle panel, lanes 1 and 2). STS also increased a secreted 95 kDa fragment detected with <b>E-cadherin</b> ectodomain <b>antibody</b> H108  <b>Figure</b> 3). This fragment (termed E-Cad/NTF1, <b>Figure</b> 2C) does not react with antibodies against cytoplasmic <b>E-cadherin</b> (not shown) and, like <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  it is also inhibited by GM6001  <b>Figure</b> 2C), suggesting that E-Cad/NTF1 is the secreted counterpart of <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  <b>Figure</b> 3). The 29 kDa fragment (E-Cad/CTF3) is inhibited by the specific caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK  <b>Figure</b> 2B, middle panel, lanes 1 and 3), indicating that it is produced by an apoptosis-stimulated caspase-3 <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> (Steinhusen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> .

The <b>-secretase</b> inhibitor L-685,458 completely blocked production of the 33 kDa cadherin fragment (E-Cad/CTF2; <b>Figure</b> 2B, middle panel, lanes 1, 4 and 5), indicating that this fragment is produced by a -secretase-like <b>cleavage</b> of E-cadherin. Inhibition of <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> by L-685,458 correlates with an increase in <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  <b>Figure</b> 2B, lower panels, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that the former peptide derives from the latter by a -secretase-like activity. Accordingly, overexpression of <b>PS1</b> in cell line HEK293 increased <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> and decreased <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  <b>Figure</b> 2D). That <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> is produced even when <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> is inhibited  <b>Figure</b> 2B, lane 2) suggests that the PS1/-secretase-dependent <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> can also be derived from full-length E-cadherin. In agreement with this suggestion, a 100 kDa <b>E-cadherin</b> fragment recognized by <b>antibody</b> H108 but not by anti-cytoplasmic <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>antibody</b> C36 (see <b>Figure</b> 3 for sequences recognized by these antibodies) was detected in cell extracts of GM6001-treated A431 cultures  <b>Figure</b> 2E), suggesting that this fragment (E-Cad/NTF2) is the N-terminal counterpart of <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> (see also <b>Figure</b> 3). In addition to A431, two other cell lines, SW480 and LNCaP, also produced the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> fragment <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> under Ca2+ influx conditions (data not shown), indicating that this is a general mechanism of <b>E-cadherin</b> processing. Identification of the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> and MMP <b>cleavage</b> sites of E-cadherinE-Cad/CTF1 and <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> were affinity purified from STS-treated A431 cells. Antibody H108 against <b>E-cadherin</b> sequence 600–707 (numbering according to the full-length unprocessed human <b>E-cadherin</b>  reacted with secreted E-Cad/NTF1  <b>Figure</b> 2C) but not with cellular <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> (not shown), suggesting that the MMP <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> occurs closer to the extracytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane than previously reported (Ito <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999). Indeed, Edman sequencing of <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> through 14 cycles showed the following major sequence: VEAGLQIPAILGIL. This is a unique sequence corresponding to human <b>E-cadherin</b> residues 701–714. The N-terminus of this sequence is located seven residues upstream of the transmembrane sequence of <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>Figure</b> 3). Mass spectrometry analysis of <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> showed no peptides upstream of the <b>cleavage</b> site that was determined by Edman sequencing (not shown). Thus, the 38 kDa <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> is produced by an MMP <b>cleavage</b> after <b>E-cadherin</b> residue Pro700  <b>Figure</b> 3). Edman sequencing of <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> yielded the following sequence: RRRAVVKEPLL. This is a unique sequence corresponding to human <b>E-cadherin</b> residues 732–742. Mass spectrometric analysis of <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> yielded <b>E-cadherin</b> peptides predicted from the sequencing data (not shown). These results show that the PS1-mediated <b>-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> takes place between residues Leu731 and Arg732 at the interface of the membrane with the cytoplasm  <b>Figure</b> 3). The -secretase-mediated <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> promotes disassembly of adherens junctionsThe molecular weight and immunoreactivity of the isolated peptides suggest that they contain the entire <b>E-cadherin</b> cytoplasmic sequence including the ß-catenin-binding site (Steinberg and McNutt, 1999). Co- immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the MMP <b>cleavage</b> product <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> binds both <b>ß-catenin</b> and <b>PS1</b>  whereas the <b>-secretase</b> product <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> binds only <b>ß-catenin</b>  <b>Figure</b> 4A). Thus, the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> dissociates <b>PS1</b> from the E-cadherin–ß-catenin complex.

Released <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> dissociates from <b>PS1</b> but remains bound             to ß-catenin. (A) Extracts from STS-treated A431 cells were             immunoprecipitated with antibodies against <b>PS1</b> (I-R222), pre-immune             serum (PI-R222), <b>ß-catenin</b> or desmoglein, and the immunoprecipitates             (IPs) obtained were probed on western blots with anti-E-cadherin             <b>antibody</b> C36. For reference, cell lysate was also probed; the             asterisk shows IgGs. (B) A431 cells treated for 6 h with STS were             fractionated into membrane, soluble cytosolic and Triton             X-100-insoluble (TX100- insoluble) fractions, and the fractions             obtained were then probed on western blots with C36 antibody. Subcellular fractionation of STS-treated A431 cells showed that full-length <b>E-cadherin</b> and <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> are found only in the membrane and cytoskeletal (Triton X-100-insoluble) fractions while <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> localizes in the membrane and in the soluble cytosol  <b>Figure</b> 4B), suggesting that the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> results in the solubilization of the cytoplasmic sequence of E-cadherin. In stable <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b>  the E-cadherin– <b>ß-catenin</b> complex of the CAJ is anchored to the actin cytoskeleton via -catenin, and this association is manifested by the insolubility of the complex components in Triton X-100 (Nathke <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1994; Baki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . Induction of apoptosis or calcium influx disrupts cadherin-mediated <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> by cleaving cadherin and disassembling the CAJ complexes (Herren <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1998; Ito <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999; Vallorosi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000; Steinhusen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . To determine whether the <b>-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> is involved in the CAJ disassembly, we induced calcium influx with ionomycin in A431 cells in the absence or presence of the <b>-secretase</b> inhibitor L-685,458. In the absence of this inhibitor, ionomycin induced a time-dependent decrease in the cytoskeletal (Triton X-100-insoluble) fraction of both full-length <b>E-cadherin</b> and <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  <b>Figure</b> 5A, left panel), and this decrease correlated with a corresponding increase in soluble cytosolic <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b>  <b>Figure</b> 5A, right panel). Similarly, ionomycin decreased the cytoskeletal association (Triton X-100-insoluble fraction) of the CAJ components ß- and -catenin with a concomitant significant increase in their soluble cytosolic levels  <b>Figure</b> 5B). These data indicate that ionomycin induces a time-dependent disassembly of the E-cadherin–catenin cytoskeletal complex resulting in increased production of the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> fragment <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> and in the solubilization of cytoskeletal ß- and -catenins. L-685,458 blocked the ionomycin-induced metabolism of cytoskeletal <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> and partially inhibited degradation of the full length <b>E-cadherin</b> (Triton X-100 insoluble, <b>Figure</b> 5A, left panel) while it abolished production of soluble cytosolic <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b>  <b>Figure</b> 5A, right panel), suggesting that L-685,458 inhibits the <b>-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of both cytoskeletal full-length <b>E-cadherin</b> and E-Cad/CTF1. In addition, L-685,458 delayed the ionomycin-induced decrease of cytoskeletal ß- and -catenin and inhibited their release to the soluble cytosol  <b>Figure</b> 5B and C).

Immunostaining and LSCM analysis of ionomycin- and             L-685,458-treated A431 cultures. A431 cells were pre-incubated for             30 min in the presence or absence of L-685,458 and then treated for             45 min with ionomycin. Control cells were not treated. Following the             ionomycin-induced <b>cell–cell</b> dissociation, the distribution of <b>PS1</b>              <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>ß-catenin</b> and -catenin in <b>al.</b> cultures was analyzed by             LSCM using the constant detector setting.

Ectodomain <b>E-cadherin</b> staining was also partially preserved at the cell surface and at <b>cell–cell</b> contacts  <b>Figure</b> 6G–I), in agreement with our finding that L-685,458 inhibits the ionomycin-induced metabolism of cytoskeletal full-length <b>E-cadherin</b>  <b>Figure</b> 5A). However, two-color immunofluorescence of L-685,458-treated cells revealed a cell population containing <b>ß-catenin</b> but no ectodomain <b>E-cadherin</b> at the cell surface (arrows in <b>Figure</b> 6I and L), suggesting that these represent junctional complexes of <b>ß-catenin</b> with <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> (see also <b>Figure</b> 4A). In L-685,458-treated cultures, there was a complete junctional overlap between staining of cytoplasmic <b>E-cadherin</b> and <b>PS1</b>  <b>Figure</b> 6C and F), suggesting that cell surface <b>PS1</b> remains bound to both full-length <b>E-cadherin</b> and E-Cad/CTF1. This observation concurs with our biochemical data showing that <b>PS1</b> binds both full-length <b>E-cadherin</b> and <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  <b>Figure</b> 4A). A cadherin mutant unable to bind <b>PS1</b> is not cleaved by the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> activityTo examine whether <b>PS1</b> binding to <b>E-cadherin</b> is necessary for the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b>  we used <b>E-cadherin</b> mutant GGG759-761AAA (Thoreson <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000). E-cadherin-negative A431D cells were transfected either with wild-type <b>E-cadherin</b> or with the <b>E-cadherin</b> mutant. In contrast to wild-type protein, mutant <b>E-cadherin</b> failed to bind <b>PS1</b>  <b>Figure</b> 7A), consistent with reports that the <b>E-cadherin</b> sequence 760–771 (corresponding to residues 604–615 of mature processed <b>E-cadherin</b>  is necessary for PS1–E-cadherin binding (Baki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . Upon ionomycin treatment, cells expressing wild-type <b>E-cadherin</b> showed a significant increase in soluble <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b>  <b>ß-catenin</b> and -catenin. In contrast, cells expressing mutant <b>E-cadherin</b> showed no ionomycin-induced increase in soluble ß- or -catenin  <b>Figure</b> 7B). Furthermore, no soluble <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> was detected in mutant transfectants in either the presence or absence of ionomycin  <b>Figure</b> 7B). Thus, <b>PS1</b> binding to <b>E-cadherin</b> is required for the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> and for the release of <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b>  <b>ß-catenin</b> and -catenin into the soluble cytosol.

Discussion       Top      Abstract      Introduction      Results      Discussion      Materials and methods      Acknowledgements      References Disassembly of CAJs and abrogation of cadherin-mediated <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> is involved in changes of cell state including differentiation, apoptosis and tumor metastasis. For example, induction of apoptotic cell death or Ca2+ imbalance involves <b>cleavage</b> of cadherins and disassembly of CAJs (Herren <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1998; Ito <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999; Vallorosi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000; Steinhusen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . Furthermore, in the case of metastasis of epithelia tumors, inhibition of E-cadherin-mediated <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> is promoted by <b>cleavage</b> and secretion of extracytoplasmic <b>E-cadherin</b> by MMPs (Lochter <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1997; Christofori and Semb, 1999; Noe <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . Although in some cell cultures <b>PS1</b> was found mainly in the ER–Golgi system (De Strooper <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1997; Cupers <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> , in cell cultures with exten sive <b>cell–cell</b> contacts and in tissues <b>PS1</b> concentrates mainly at the plasma membrane (Georgakopoulos <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999; Nowotny <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000; Xia <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b>  and, in the brain, this protein concentrates at synaptic contacts (Georgakopoulos <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999; Ribaut-Barassin <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000). In addition, <b>PS1</b> has been detected in vesicles (Efthimiopoulos <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1998) and at the surface of both Drosophila cells (Nowotny <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000) and adhesive lamellipodia (Schwarzman <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999). The plasma membrane localization of <b>PS1</b> is entirely consistent with its role in the processing of cell surface transmembrane proteins including APP, Notch1 receptor and E-cadherin. Our data define a novel mechanism of CAJ disassembly  <b>Figure</b> 7C). Key steps in this mechanism are the proteolytic <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> by a <b>PS1/-secretase</b> activity at the membrane–cytoplasm interface and a novel MMP <b>cleavage</b> of extracellular <b>E-cadherin</b> that occurs close to the plasma membrane. <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b>  the product of the MMP <b>cleavage</b>  remains bound to catenins and anchored to the cytoskeleton  <b>Figure</b> 7C). The <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> dissociates both <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> and full-length <b>E-cadherin</b> from the cytoskeleton and promotes solubilization of cytoskeletal ß- and -catenin, thus promoting disassembly of the CAJs. That the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>cleavage</b> is significantly increased upon cell apoptosis or Ca2+ imbalance suggests the existence of signaling mechanisms that regulate the activity of the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> proteolytic system. It was shown recently that under conditions that favor <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b>  <b>PS1</b> stabilizes the E-cadherin–catenin <b>adhesion</b> complex (Baki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . Combined with the present data, this suggests that with regard to the formation and disassembly of CAJs, <b>PS1</b> may have two distinct activities. (i) Under conditions promoting <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b>  incorporation of <b>PS1</b> into the E-cadherin–catenin complex results in the stabilization of <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> (Baki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . (ii) In contrast, under conditions of <b>cell–cell</b> dissociation or apoptosis, <b>PS1</b> promotes disassembly of adherens junctions, thus facilitating cell separation. Having both activities in the same polypeptide may represent an efficient and quick way for the formation and dissolution of <b>cell–cell</b> contacts. Interestingly p120ctn, a protein that like <b>PS1</b> binds the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of <b>E-cadherin</b>  has also been shown to have either positive or negative effects on CAJ-mediated <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> (Thoreson <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000). Induction of the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> results in the release of the E-Cad/CTF2–ß-catenin complex from the cytoskeleton and in a significant increase in the soluble cytosolic <b>ß-catenin</b>  <b>Figure</b> 5C). Free cytosolic <b>ß-catenin</b> is a key potent regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. It translocates to the nucleus where it complexes with Lef-1/Tcf transcription factors to activate expression of target genes (Polakis, 2000). Thus, production of the E-Cad/CTF2–ß-catenin complex, rather than free <b>ß-catenin</b>  may provide a large pool of complexed inactive <b>ß-catenin</b> from where it could be released according to the transcriptional needs of the cell. The potential importance of <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> in signal transduction is indicated in recent studies using artificial constructs overexpressing soluble cytoplasmic cadherin sequences. These constructs bind <b>ß-catenin</b> and inhibit the ß-catenin/Lef-1/Tcf signaling events (Sadot <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1998; Gottardi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . In addition, by sequestering <b>ß-catenin</b>  these constructs act as dominant-negative agents in cell growth and development (Sanson <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1996; Gottardi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> . Thus the PS1/-secretase-derived <b>E-Cad/CTF2</b> may provide a cellular regulatory link between changes in the E-cadherin-based <b>cell–cell</b> <b>adhesion</b> and the Wnt signal transduction pathway. That PS1–/– mouse embryos accumulate <b>E-Cad/CTF1</b> indicates that <b>PS1/-secretase</b> processing of E-cadherins occurs early in development and may control cadherin-mediated developmental processes and cell fate decisions. The <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> shows several important differences from the corresponding cleavages in APP and Notch. Recent data (Gu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2001; Sastre <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2001; Yu <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b>  suggest that the APP <b>cleavage</b> may not occur in the middle of the transmembrane sequence of APP that defines the C- terminus of Aß peptides, but rather closer to the cytoplasm about three residues inside the membrane. Our data show that the <b>-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of <b>E-cadherin</b> takes place at the end of the transmembrane sequence probably outside the lipid bilayer at the membrane–cytoplasm interface, suggesting that an intramembranous <b>cleavage</b> may not be a requirement for the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> proteolytic system. Similarly to APP and Notch, <b>-secretase</b> cleaves a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment of <b>E-cadherin</b> resulting from an ectodomain cleavage. In contrast to full-length APP and Notch, however, which do not seem to be cleaved by <b>-secretase</b>  full-length <b>E-cadherin</b> may also be processed by this activity. Finally, our data suggest that <b>E-cadherin</b> mutants unable to bind <b>PS1</b> are not cleaved by the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> system. It would be important to determine whether <b>PS1</b> binding to APP or Notch is a requirement for the <b>-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of these proteins. Our findings have important implications for Alzheimer’s disease because they raise the possibility that the <b>PS1</b> FAD mutants affect the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> of several CAJ systems. We observed that in addition to <b>E-cadherin</b>  two more classic cadherins, N- and VE-cadherins, both of which display high homology to <b>E-cadherin</b>  are metabolized by the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> system (unpublished observations). Both E- and N-cadherins have been found at the synapse and are reported to play key roles in synaptic structure and function (Fannon and Colman, 1996; Tang <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1998; Tanaka <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  2000). In addition, VE-cadherin plays important roles in endothelial permeability (Sandoval <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  <b>2001</b> , vascular integrity (Corada <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999) and survival signaling of endothelial tissue (Carmeliet <b>et</b> <b>al.</b>  1999). It will be important to examine what roles, if any, the <b>PS1/-secretase</b> <b>cleavage</b> plays in the functions of the above cadherin systems. Furthermore, it will be important to determine any potential effects of the <b>PS1</b> FAD mutants on the <b>-secretase</b> processing of classic cadherins and their functions. However, our data suggest that potential therapeutic treatments targeting <b>-secretase</b> may also affect the proteolytic processing and/or function of a number of cadherin adhesion/signaling systems.
