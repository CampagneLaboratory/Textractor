      Discussion References Here we show that presenilin-1 (PS1), a protein involved in Alzheimer's 
disease, binds directly to epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin). This 
binding is mediated by the large cytoplasmic loop of PS1 and requires 
the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic sequence 604-615 of mature 
E-cadherin. This sequence is also required for E-cadherin binding of 
protein p120, a known regulator of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. 
Using wild-type and PS1 knockout cells, we found that increasing PS1 
levels suppresses p120/E-cadherin binding, and increasing p120 levels 
suppresses PS1/E-cadherin binding. Thus PS1 and p120 bind to and 
mutually compete for cellular E-cadherin. Furthermore, PS1 stimulates 
E-cadherin binding to beta- and gamma-catenin, promotes cytoskeletal association of the 
cadherin/catenin complexes, and increases Ca2+-dependent 
cell-cell aggregation. Remarkably, PS1 familial Alzheimer disease 
mutant DeltaE9 
increased neither the levels of cadherin/catenin complexes nor cell 
aggregation, suggesting that this familial Alzheimer disease mutation 
interferes with cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion. These data 
identify PS1 as an E-cadherin-binding protein and a regulator of 
E-cadherin function in vivo.                Introduction        Top Abstract Introduction Materials and

      Discussion References Presenilin-1 (PS1) mutations are responsible for most cases of early-onset 
familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). PS1 is a transmembrane protein 
expressed in many tissues, including brain, where it is enriched in 
neurons (1, 2). PS1 crosses the 
membrane eight times, with the N terminus, the C terminus, and the 
large hydrophilic loop all located in the cytoplasm. Most cellular 
PS1 is cleaved within the large cytoplasmic loop to yield N-terminal 
fragments (PS1/NTF) of approximately 30 kDa and C-terminal 
fragments (PS1/CTF) of approximately 20 kDa. After cleavage, the 
PS1 fragments form stable 1:1 heterodimers (3, 4). PS1 facilitates 
processing of Notch-1 receptor, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
(5, 
6) 
stimulates production of Abeta peptide (6) and may 
play a role in neuroprotection (7, 8). Mice lacking 
PS1 (PS1-/-) die shortly after birth 
with skeletal malformations, impaired neurogenesis, and brain 
hemorrhage (7). 
Recently, we reported that PS1 concentrates at synaptic and epithelial 
cell-cell contact sites, where it forms complexes with the 
cadherin/catenin adhesion system (9). Classic 
cadherins, including E-cadherin and neuronal cadherin (N-cadherin), 
are a family of type I transmembrane proteins that mediate 
Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion and recognition, and control 
critical events in neurogenesis, tissue development, and tissue 
homeostasis (10, 11). These 
functions are mediated by homophilic interactions of the 
extracellular region of cadherins. The membrane-distal cytoplasmic 
sequence of cadherins binds either beta-catenin or gamma-catenin (plakoglobin), which in turn binds alpha-catenin. The latter 
protein binds polymerized actin, thus linking the cadherin/catenin 
adhesion complex to the cortical cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal linkage 
of the cadherin/catenin complexes is crucial for the full 
expression of the adhesive functions of surface cadherins (12-14). beta-Catenin and 
gamma-catenin, two 
highly homologous members of the armadillo family of proteins (for a 
review see ref. 15), bind the 
same sequence of cytoplasmic cadherin in a mutually exclusive 
manner (16, 17). The 
juxtamembrane (membrane-proximal) region of cytoplasmic cadherins 
binds p120 (also called p120ctn), a cytosolic protein originally 
identified as a target for p60v-src kinase and later shown to 
regulate cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and tumor metastasis 
(for a review see ref. 18). Although PS1 binds to the cadherin/catenin adhesion complex (9), the mechanism 
and functional consequences of this association remain obscure. Here 
we show that PS1 binds directly to juxtamembrane cytoplasmic cadherin 
and inhibits cadherin binding of p120. Furthermore, PS1 stabilizes 
the cadherin/catenin complex, promotes its cytoskeletal association, 
and stimulates Ca2+-dependent cell-cell aggregation. In contrast, PS1 
FAD mutant DeltaE9 failed to stabilize the cadherin/catenin complex and did 
not stimulate cell-cell aggregation.                Materials and Methods        Top Abstract Introduction Materials

Fibroblast cell lines were from wild-type (WT) (PS1 +/+) and PS1 
knockout (PS1-/-) mice 
(9), and L cells 
were from the American Type Culture Collection. Stable transfections 
of E-cadherin cDNAs cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) were 
performed as described (2, 9). Transient 
transfections were performed with Lipofectamine Plus, and cells were 
processed for IP or cell aggregation 36 h later. Aggregation 
assays were performed as described (9, 12) in 
the presence or absence of 2 mM Ca2+. The degree of aggregation 
and size of aggregates was documented by photography. IPs were 
performed as described (9) and 
analyzed on Western blots (WBs). Mouse embryos at day 17 were 
rinsed in ice-cold PBS and frozen in a dry ice/methanol bath. 
Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of tail DNA (7), and frozen 
PS1+/+ or PS1-/- embryos were homogenized in 
ice-cold TNE buffer [25 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.6)/150 mM NaCl/1× complete 
protease inhibitor mixture/1 mM EDTA] plus 1% Triton X-100. 
Homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the

      References PS1/E-cadherin Binding Is Independent of Catenins. PS1 is a 
component of the E-cadherin/beta-catenin adhesion complex (9). Examination of 
E-cadherin, gamma-catenin, and PS1 IPs prepared from confluent 
Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cultures (9) revealed that 
PS1 is also a component of the E-cadherin/gamma-catenin complex (Fig. 1A). Because 
PS1 binds beta-catenin 
(19, 20), we 
attempted to determine whether PS1 binds E-cadherin independent 
of catenins. Triton X-100 extracted most of PS1/CTF from a beta-catenin IP 
but failed to extract any PS1/CTF from an E-cadherin IP, indicating 
that the PS1/E-cadherin binding might be distinct from the PS1/beta-catenin 
binding (Fig. 1B, 
Lower). To further test this hypothesis, we prepared PS1 IPs 
from L cells transfected with either full-length E-cadherin (EL 
cells) or with E-cadherin deletion construct EDeltaC71 that lacks the last 
(membrane-distal) 71 cytoplasmic amino acids that bind beta- and gamma-catenin (EDeltaC71L cells; see Fig. 2A). 
Untransfected L cells contain no detectable E-cadherin (21), and PS1 IPs 
from these cells did not react with anti-E-cadherin antibodies 
(Fig. 2B, lanes 
1 and 5). In E-cadherin-transfected cells, however, PS1 formed 
complexes with both full-length and EDeltaC71 cadherins (Fig. 2B, lanes 
2 and 3 and 6 and 7). Because construct EDeltaC71 lacks the 
catenin-binding sequence and binds neither beta- nor gamma-catenin (data not shown; 
see also refs. 14 and 22), our data 
show that PS1 associates with E-cadherin even when catenins are 
not bound to E-cadherin. Chemical crosslinking is used to 
analyze direct protein-protein contacts within protein complexes, 
including the cadherin/catenin complex (22, 23). PS1 IPs 
prepared from crosslinked EL or EDeltaC71L cells contained 
E-cadherin-reactive, SDS-resistant complexes of approximate apparent 
molecular mass 170 kDa and 160 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2C). The 
apparent molecular mass of the crosslinked products is in excellent 
agreement with the predicted molecular mass of a ternary complex 
containing one molecule each of PS1/CTF, PS1/NTF, and full length or 
truncated E-cadherin, respectively. These complexes were 
immunoprecipitated with anti-PS1/NTF antibody R222 and reacted with 
anti-PS1/CTF antibody 33B10, verifying that they contain both PS1 
fragments (Fig. 2C). These 
data show that PS1 binds directly to E-cadherin at a sequence 
distinct from the catenin-binding site and suggest that the two 
proteins combine in a 1:1 ratio.                                         View larger version

            4, 8, and 12) were treated with antibody R222 (lanes 5-8) 
            or anti-p120 antibody (lanes 9-12), and the resulting IPs were 
            probed on WBs with anti-E-cadherin antibody H108. For reference, 
            20 µg of cell lysates was probed (lanes 1-4). (C) 
            Confluent EL or EDeltaC71L cells were incubated either with the 
            crosslinking agent dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) in DMSO 
            or with DMSO alone, and cell extracts were then prepared in RIPA 
            buffer in the presence of SDS to inhibit noncovalent associations. 
            Lysates were treated with antibody R222 (R222 IP), and the resulting 
            IPs were probed on WBs with anti-E-cadherin (H108) or anti-PS1/CTF 
            (33B10) antibodies. Twenty micrograms of cell lysate was probed with 
            H108 antibody. (D) PS1 construct Delta340-375 does not bind 
            E-cadherin. HEK293 cells expressing WT PS1 (WT) or a PS1 construct 
            with amino acid deletion 340-375 (Delta340-375) were lysed in 
            TNE plus 1% digitonin. Lysates were treated with anti-E-cadherin 
            antibody (E-cad IP), and the resulting IPs were probed on WBs with 
            antibody 33B10. Twenty micrograms of cell lysates was also probed. 
            PS1/CTF Mediates PS1 Binding to Juxtamembrane Cytoplasmic 
E-cadherin. Triton X-100 treatment of a digitonin E-cadherin IP extracted 
the PS1/NTF but not the PS1/CTF, which remained associated with 
E-cadherin (Fig. 1B). This 
result suggests that PS1 binding to E-cadherin may be mediated by 
peptide PS1/CTF and is in agreement with recent data that the binding 
between PS1/NTF and PS1/CTF is sensitive to Triton X-100 extraction 
(20). Together 
with the chemical crosslinking data (see above), these results 
suggest that PS1/CTF, which contains PS1 sequence 299-467 (3), mediates 
the PS1/E-cadherin binding. In vitro blot overlay assays 
showed that PS1 sequence 256-410, which includes the entire large 
cytoplasmic loop, binds to the cytoplasmic sequence of E-cadherin 
(data not shown). Fig. 2D shows 
that, whereas full-length PS1/CTF bound E-cadherin in vivo, a 
PS1/CTF construct lacking sequence 340-375 did not. In contrast, 
PS1/CTF construct lacking sequence 299-330 bound E-cadherin (data not 
shown). Combined, these results show that PS1 sequence 340-375 of the 
large cytoplasmic loop is required for PS1 binding to cytoplasmic 
E-cadherin. The observation that PS1 binds E-cadherin lacking the last 
71 cytoplasmic residues, combined with in vitro experiments 
showing that the PS1 sequence binds cytoplasmic E-cadherin, 
suggested that PS1 binds within the remaining membrane proximal 
80 residues of cytoplasmic E-cadherin (Fig. 2A). Because 
these residues also mediate E-cadherin binding of protein p120, a 
regulator of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion (21, 24), we asked 
whether there is an overlap between the E-cadherin sequences that 
mediate binding of both proteins. Indeed, deletion of E-cadherin 
cytoplasmic sequence 604-615, which is required for p120 binding to 
E-cadherin (Fig. 2B, lanes 
4 and 12; and ref. 21), also 
abolished E-cadherin-PS1 binding (Fig. 2B, lanes 
4 and 8), showing that this sequence is critical for E-cadherin 
binding of both PS1 and p120. 
PS1 Competes with p120 for E-cadherin Binding in 
Vivo. That the same E-cadherin sequence is required for binding of both 
PS1 and p120 suggests that these proteins might compete for 
E-cadherin binding. Indeed, E-cadherin IPs prepared from PS1-/- mouse embryos contained 
significantly more p120 than E-cadherin IPs from PS1+/+ embryos (Fig. 
3A). To 
further explore this phenomenon, we used fibroblast cells derived 
from PS1-/- and PS1+/+ mice. Because 
these cells express undetectable levels of endogenous E-cadherin, we 
transfected both of them and selected lines expressing similar levels 
of exogenous human E-cadherin (Fig. 3B). As 
expected, transfected E-cadherin coimmunoprecipitated with peptide 
PS1/CTF in PS1+/+ cells but not in PS1-/- cells (Fig. 3C; see also 
Fig. 5A, 
Right, for the reverse experiment). E-cadherin IPs prepared 
from PS1-/- cells contained significantly 
higher levels of p120 than did E-cadherin IPs from PS1+/+ cells (Fig. 
3D, 
Left), even though the two cell lines contain similar levels 
of cellular p120 (Fig. 3D, Lower 
Right). In the reverse experiments, p120 IPs from PS1-/- cells contained more E-cadherin 
than did p120 IPs from PS1+/+ cells (Fig. 3D, Upper 
Right). Reintroduction of PS1 into PS1-/- cells by transfection reduced the 
E-cadherin/p120 complex (Fig. 3E Left and 
Middle) and induced the appearance of the E-cadherin/PS1 
complex (Fig. 3E Right). 
These data show that PS1 inhibits p120 binding to E-cadherin. 
Conversely, overexpression of p120 in EL cells decreased the 
E-cadherin/PS1 complex while it increased the E-cadherin/p120 complex 
(Fig. 3F, 
Lower and Upper, respectively). Thus, p120 is also 
capable of inhibiting PS1 binding to E-cadherin. In summary, our data 
show that PS1 binds E-cadherin and promotes the dissociation of the 
E-cadherin/p120 complex. The reverse is also true; p120 binds 
E-cadherin and promotes the dissociation of the E-cadherin/PS1 
complex. Taken together, our results indicate that the two proteins 
compete for E-cadherin binding in vivo.                                         View larger version

Cadherin/Catenin Complex and Stimulates Ca2+-Dependent Cell-Cell 
Aggregation. Recent reports suggest that PS1 regulates cell-cell adhesion, 
but the molecular basis of this regulation remains unknown (9). That 
PS1 competes with p120 for E-cadherin binding suggests that PS1 may 
function as an additional regulator of the cadherin-based adhesion 
system. Indeed, in the presence of Ca2+, E-cadherin-transfected 
PS1-/- cells aggregated poorly 
compared with E-cadherin-transfected PS1+/+ cells, suggesting that 
PS1 stimulates Ca2+-dependent cell-cell aggregation (Fig. 
4A). 
Untransfected PS1+/+ cells expressing undetectable levels of 
E-cadherin showed little aggregation compared with 
E-cadherin-transfected PS1+/+ cells (Fig. 4A), 
indicating that aggregation is E-cadherin-mediated. Reintroduction of 
WT PS1 into PS1-/- cells substantially 
increased Ca2+-dependent cell-cell aggregation (Fig. 4B). In 
contrast to WT PS1 that was able to restore cadherin-dependent 
aggregation, PS1 mutant DeltaE9 was inactive (Fig. 4B).                                         View larger version

            (+E-cad) PS1 +/+ (+/+) and PS1-/- (-/-) fibroblasts were 
            allowed to aggregate for 4 h in the presence (+Ca2+) 
            or absence (-Ca2+) of calcium (see Materials and 
            Methods). (B) E-cadherin-expressing PS1-/- fibroblasts, 
            transiently transfected with vector (Vector), WT PS1 (wtPS1), or PS1 
            FAD mutant DeltaE9 (PS1DeltaE9), were assayed for aggregation in the presence or 
            absence of calcium. (Right) Extracts (1% Triton X-100) from 
            the transiently transfected cultures shown in B were treated 
            with antibody 33B10, and the resulting IPs (PS1/CTF IP) were 
            analyzed for expression of the transfected PS1 proteins. To further explore the possible mechanism by which PS1 stimulates 
cell-cell adhesion, we determined the PS1 effects on the stability of 
the cadherin/catenin complexes with the use of E-cadherin-transfected 
PS1-/- and PS1+/+ fibroblasts expressing 
similar levels of exogenous E-cadherin (see above). E-cadherin IPs 
prepared from confluent PS1+/+ cells contained significantly higher 
levels of gamma-, beta-, and alpha-catenin than 
E-cadherin IPs from PS1-/- cells 
(Fig. 5A). 
In the reverse experiments gamma-, beta-, 
and alpha-catenin IPs 
from PS1 +/+ cells contained higher levels of E-cadherin than the 
corresponding IPs from PS1-/- cells 
(Fig. 5B). PS1 had 
a more dramatic effect on the E-cadherin/gamma-catenin association than on the 
E-cadherin/beta-catenin association (Fig. 5 A and 
B). Reintroduction of WT PS1 in PS1-/- cells increased the 
E-cadherin complexes not only with PS1 (Fig. 3E, 
Right), but also with both beta- and gamma-catenin (Fig. 5 C and 
D, respectively). Interestingly, in contrast to WT PS1, FAD 
mutant DeltaE9 failed to stimulate binding of gamma-catenin to E-cadherin (Fig. 
5D) 
and was less effective than the WT PS1 in stimulating the 
E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex (Fig. 5C). 
Together with the data from the aggregation experiments, these 
results suggest that WT PS1, but not PS1 mutant DeltaE9, stimulates 
Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion by stabilizing the 
cadherin/catenin adhesion complex.                                         View larger version

Complex. Stable cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion in intact cells 
requires linkage of the cadherin/beta- and gamma-catenin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton (12, 13, 23). This linkage 
is mediated by alpha-catenin (25) and is 
manifested by an increased insolubility of the cadherin/catenin 
complex components in Triton X-100 (23). 
Examination of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin IPs prepared from 
PS1+/+ and PS1-/- 
fibroblasts showed that the former cells contained higher levels of 
the E-cadherin/alpha-catenin complexes than the latter cells (Fig. 5 A and 
B), suggesting that PS1 may ultimately stimulate the 
cytoskeletal association of the cadherin/catenin adhesion complexes. 
Indeed, Fig. 6A shows 
that in PS1+/+ cells a significantly higher fraction of total gamma-catenin was found in 
the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction compared with PS1-/- cells, where almost all of the gamma-catenin was 
found in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. E-cadherin also showed an 
increased distribution in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in 
PS1+/+ cells compared with PS1-/- cells, 
suggesting an increased cytoskeletal association (Fig. 6A). Similar 
results were obtained for beta-catenin (data not shown). PS1 
transfection of PS1-/- cells 
stimulated the cytoskeletal association of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin, whereas 
transfection with the FAD DeltaE9 did not (Fig. 6B), in 
agreement with the inability of this FAD mutant to stabilize the 
cadherin/catenin complexes and to stimulate cell-cell adhesion.                                         View larger version

      Methods Results 
      Discussion References Cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion and communication are critical determinants 
of tissue development, function, and homeostasis (10, 11). The present 
study shows that PS1 binds directly to E-cadherin. Remarkably, this 
binding requires mature E-cadherin amino acids 604-615, which are 
also required for E-cadherin binding of p120, a regulator of 
cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (21, 24). PS1 displaces 
p120 from E-cadherin, stabilizes the binding of beta- and gamma-catenins to E-cadherin, increases 
linkage of the cadherin/catenin complex to the cytoskeleton, and 
stimulates Ca2+- and cadherin-dependent cell-cell aggregation. These 
findings show that PS1 regulates the molecular composition and 
function of the cadherin-based adhesion system and suggest a possible 
mechanism for PS1-induced stabilization of the cadherin/catenin 
complex (Fig. 7). PS1/CTF 
sequence 340-375 binds E-cadherin sequence 604-615 and may tether the 
membrane-proximal cytoplasmic E-cadherin close to the plasma 
membrane. At a more distal site on E-cadherin are bound beta- or gamma-catenin (16, 17), which in turn 
may bind PS1 (19, 20). These 
interactions could result in the formation of a stable three-member 
complex, each member of which binds directly to the other two. beta-Catenin or gamma-catenin binds alpha-catenin, which 
in turn anchors the complexes to the cytoskeleton, consistent 
with the increased cytoskeletal association of E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and 
gamma-catenin induced 
by PS1.                                         View larger version

            for PS1/E-cadherin complex formation). For more details see text. 
            Cadherins are expressed in specific patterns throughout the embryonic and 
adult life of vertebrates. At least 15 different classic 
cadherins have been detected in the central nervous system, where 
they function as guidance molecules in neurite target recognition and 
synapse formation and regulate synaptic plasticity (10, 11, 26, 27). The cadherin 
region critical for PS1 binding is conserved in classic cadherins 
including E-, N-, P- (placental), R- (retinal), and vascular 
endothelial cadherin (18). This 
region is crucial for cell adhesion during embryogenesis (28), for 
N-cadherin-mediated neurite outgrowth (29), cell motility 
(30), 
and regulation of N- and vascular endothelial-cadherin expression 
in endothelial cell junctions (31). Thus PS1 may 
regulate the function of multiple cadherin systems during development 
and adult life. That PS1 is important for central nervous system 
development is suggested by PS1 null mice that die shortly after 
birth with severe abnormalities of CNS development and impaired 
vascular integrity (7). Members of the cadherin adhesion complex, including E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and p120, have 
been identified as important oncogenes (15, 18, 32). That PS1 
regulates their association suggests that PS1 itself might be 
involved in cancer development. E-cadherin is the main adhesion 
molecule of epithelia, and dysfunction of E-cadherin complexes has 
been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis of human epithelial 
cancer (32). 
That PS1 promotes cadherin adhesion raises the possibility that loss 
of PS1 function might decrease cell-cell adhesion and promote cancer 
development. This model suggests an explanation for the surprising 
observation that PS1 down-regulation leads to the formation of 
epidermal tumors in adult mice (33). It is of great interest that in contrast to WT PS1, PS1 FAD mutant DeltaE9 failed to increase 
cell-cell aggregation and stimulated neither formation of 
cadherin/catenin complexes nor the cytoskeletal association of 
cadherin and catenins. This mutant lacks the PS1 cleavage site and is 
not cleaved intracellularly (3, 4). 
Thus, the inability of this mutant to stimulate cell-cell adhesion 
may be due to a lack of functional PS1 fragments. We observed 
that uncleaved DeltaE9 mutant forms complexes with E-cadherin (S.E. and 
N.K.R., unpublished observations), suggesting that incorporation of 
uncleaved PS1 into the cadherin/catenin complex cannot substitute 
functionally for the PS1 fragments. It remains an interesting 
question whether the lack of function of mutant DeltaE9 contributes to the 
development of the FAD phenotype. Recent evidence shows that PS1 forms complexes with APP and Notch-1 receptor 
and regulates production of Abeta (5, 6). Like 
E-cadherin, APP and Notch-1 are type I transmembrane proteins, but 
the mechanism(s) involved in the PS1 binding to APP and Notch-1 
receptor is still not clear. Our findings on the sequence involved 
in E-cadherin/PS1 binding suggest a model for PS1 binding to APP 
and Notch-1 receptors. In addition, cadherin is involved in cell 
adhesion and signaling, and APP may have similar functions (34, 35). That PS1 
forms complexes with the APP, Notch-1, and E-cadherin systems 
suggests that in addition to APP processing, PS1 FAD mutations may 
target other type I transmembrane protein systems, including Notch-1 
and cadherins. That PS1 FAD mutants may affect an array of protein 
systems is in agreement with evidence that Alzheimer's disease is a 
heterogeneous disorder with multiple systems affected (36, 37).                AcknowledgementsWe thank Drs. Tonegawa and Potter for PS1+/- Tg mice, Dr. P. Saftig for
