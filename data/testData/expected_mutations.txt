Therefore , the >R79K< substitution seems to have a greater effect on dGuo binding than on 
that of dAdo , but dGK modification appears to produce a stimulatory conformational effect on the 
opposite subunit , resembling the known unidirectional activation of dAK by either dGuo or dGTP

one bears the >R79K< mutation on both the dAK and dGK subunits , while the other

All three types of Asp-78 mutations D78A , >D78E< , and D78N , involving both subunits 
virtually eliminated both dAK and dGK activities , being less than 0.2 of the activities found

While preliminary assays not shown revealed a reduction in the dGK activities of both the >R79K< 
and R79K:dGK mutants , the dAK activities were increased dramatically , whether or not the dAK 
subunit was altered

Preliminary enzyme activation and inhibition studies were carried out to determine whether these regulatory mechanisms might 
have been altered by >R79K< mutations 
--- 7 --- : < enter here properties as inferred from evidence in the text below:
While both mutant enzymes remain susceptible to inhibition by end products dGTP or dATP , activation 
of dAK by dGuo is nearly eliminated in the case of the R79K:dGK mutant , while 
for the tandemly mutated >R79K< , there was even a 30 inhibition of the dAK activity 
upon addition of dGuo

The other striking effect of mutations at Arg-79 is seen upon comparison of true maximum velocities 
which are proportional to the turnover number Table 2 . The turnover of dAK was increased 
8-fold by the tandem >R79K< mutation and nearly 30-fold above that of UMCE by the R79K:dGK 
mutation , respectively

The other conclusion which can be inferred from these data is that , in terms of 
the V max K m efficiency ratios , the >R29K< mutations can be said to have 
had opposite effects on the activities of the two subunits 
--- 10 --- : < enter here properties as inferred from evidence in the text below:
The K i values for end product inhibition against each substrate were decreased up to 75 
in dAK , but were increased about 2-fold in dGK by both the >R79K< and R79K:dGK 
mutations Table 3 . However , neither the dNTP inhibition pattern nor , therefore , the 
kinetic mechanism of either enzyme was affected by mutations at Arg-79 
--- 11 --- : < enter here properties as inferred from evidence in the text below:
Whereas the dGK activities of >R79K< and R79K:dGK were reduced substantially , the dAK activities of 
those mutant enzymes were elevated dramatically above that of UMCE 
--- 12 --- : < enter here properties as inferred from evidence in the text below:
It is important to note , however , that for R79K:dGK the K m for dAdo 
is unchanged , whereas it increases severalfold in the >R79K< mutant where both subunits are altered 

--- 13 --- : < enter here properties as inferred from evidence in the text below:
The >R79K< mutation has opposite effects on the K m values for MgATP at the two 
active sites , but lower K m values on dAK would not account for the stimulation 
as the assay is carried out under near-saturating conditions with respect to MgATP

ii The one-way stimulation of the dAK activity by dGuo or dGTP , by affinity labeling 
of the dGK subunit 8 and by >R79K< mutagenesis also supports this notion

iii The opposite effects of >R79K< replacement on the binding of MgATP to the two subunits 
, despite similar sequences , also suggests differences in folding or contact points of the heterodimer 

--- 16 --- : < enter here properties as inferred from evidence in the text below:
The detailed mechanism of the enhancement of dAK activity by >R79K< replacement is still unknown , 
but it seems most likely that Arg-79 is located near the contact area , possibly in 
a loop , between the dAK and dGK subunit , and the amino acid residues involved 
in the substrate binding site of one subunit might effect on the overall rate-limiting reaction steps 
of the paired subunit

The comparison of the pKa values clearly shows that in the double mutant R82A G231C the 
pKa of Asp-85 in the presence of the protonated group X H is shifted back from 
6.9 in R82A pK in micelles 30 to 3.0 , i.e. lower than the wild type 
value pKa 4.7 . This should be compared with the Asp-85 pKa value of 2.6 and 
2.1 in membranes for wt and >R82A< G231C , respectively Table I . These results indicate 
that the electrostatic environments for these residues Asp-85 and X H differ in the double mutant 
and in wt. Also the pKa of Asp-85 in the presence of the deprotonated group X 
- like in the M-state , pKa 5.8 , differs slightly from the wild type value 
pKa 6.3 . Similar shifts are observed for the pKa of X H in the double

A similar time constant of about 150 µs was observed for a contribution from a 13-cis-photoproduct

Proton release was observed with about 1.4 and 14 ms on the cytoplasmic surface with the 
dye in position 160 and about 1 ms at the extracellular surface in position 72. Comparison 
with time-resolved photovoltage measurements of >R82A< under the same conditions2 indicates there may be a transient 
protonation and deprotonation without net transport correlated with the H uptake time of 150 µs and 
the first H release time of about 1 ms , respectively , very likely attributed to 
the 13-cis-photocycle

Furthermore , net proton transfer is observed in the electrical measurements of the purple form of 
R82A.2 Together with our results that proton uptake in >R82A< clearly takes place at the cytoplasmic 
surface , we conclude that the direction of proton pumping is the same as in wild 
type , with proton release at the extracellular and uptake at the cytoplasmic surface 
--- 149 --- : < enter here properties as inferred from evidence in the text below:
This interpretation was based on the fact that the proton uptake time in >R82Q< , monitored 
in the aqueous bulk phase , was virtually the same as in wild type

Our results , on the other hand , provide evidence that the mutation >R82A< , the 
substitution of a residue in the proton release channel close to the extracellular surface , affects 
not only the proton release , but in particular the proton uptake time at the opposite 
surface 1 µs compared with 8 ms in the wt-like mutant A160C , as monitored directly 
at the cytoplasmatic protein surface

The second site revertants of mutants containing single replacements at position 82 in bR like >R82A< 
and R82Q are of particular interest , because Arg-82 has been proposed to be involved in 
multiple types of interactions , as part of the counterion of the Schiff base proton electrostatic 
interaction , in interactions with the primary and terminal proton release groups electrostatic and structural-conformational interactions 
, and during folding structural-electrostatic interaction

These differences may help to explain why the mutational change in position 231 at the cytoplasmic 
surface far away from position 82 see Fig. 1 is able to revert many of the
