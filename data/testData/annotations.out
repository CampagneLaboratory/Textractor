Therefore the >R79K< substitution seems to have a greater effect on dGuo binding than on that 
of dAdo but dGK modification appears to produce a stimulatory conformational effect on the opposite subunit 
resembling the known unidirectional activation of dAK by either dGuo or dGTP INTRODUCTION The four deoxynucleoside 
kinases of Lactobacillus acidophilus R26 exhibit a level of specificity for their respective deoxynucleoside substrates previously 
unknown among this class of enzymes

However there was no apparent increase in the amount of peptide expressed Preliminary enzyme activation and

The turnover of dAK was increased 8 fold by the tandem >R79K< mutation and nearly 30 
fold above that of UMCE by the R79K dGK mutation respectively Under V max conditions these 
stimulatory affects cannot be explained in terms of any alteration of substrate binding at the dAK 
active site whereas the relatively large changes in the K m values of both substrates for 
the dGK signal significant conformational changes at the dGK active site which may be capable of 
altering the tautness of the dAK subunit like the positive heterotropic effector dGuo but greater in 
magnitude

The other conclusion which can be inferred from these data is that in terms of the

effects on the activities of the two subunits

It is important to note however that for >R79K< dGK the K m for dAdo is 
unchanged whereas it increases severalfold in the R79K mutant where both subunits are altered Stimulation by 
dGuo has been shown to be purely a V max effect producing no change in the 
K m for dAdo 7 and the R79K dGK mutation seems to have had an identical 
effect

The >R79K< mutation has opposite effects on the K m values for MgATP at the two 
active sites but lower K m values on dAK would not account for the stimulation as 
the assay is carried out under near saturating conditions with respect to MgATP 
*--- 21 --- R79K:mutation < enter here properties as inferred from evidence in the text below:
This is consistent with the understanding that dATP behaves as a multisubstrate analog bridging the deoxynucleoside 
and ATP phosphate sites ii The one way stimulation of the dAK activity by dGuo or 
dGTP by affinity labeling of the dGK subunit 8 and by >R79K< mutagenesis also supports this 
notion iii The opposite effects of R79K replacement on the binding of MgATP to the two 
subunits despite similar sequences also suggests differences in folding or contact points of the heterodimer

The detailed mechanism of the enhancement of dAK activity by >R79K< replacement is still unknown but 
it seems most likely that Arg 79 is located near the contact area possibly in a 
loop between the dAK and dGK subunit and the amino acid residues involved in the substrate 
binding site of one subunit might effect on the overall rate limiting reaction steps of the 
paired subunit

The second site revertants of mutants containing single replacements at position 82 in bR like >R82A<
and R82Q are of particular interest because Arg 82 has been proposed to be involved in
multiple types of interactions as part of the counterion of the Schiff base proton electrostatic interaction
in interactions with the primary and terminal proton release groups electrostatic and structural conformational interactions and
during folding structural electrostatic interaction

These differences may help to explain why the mutational change in position 231 at the cytoplasmic
surface far away from position 82 see Fig 1 is able to revert many of the
altered properties in >R82A< back to wild type

A conformational change in helix G introduced by the mutation >G231C< can lead to a different

Therefore it might be that in the mutant protein >G231C< the arginine 82 side chain is
