TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES ABSTRACT To understand the role that ARF6 plays in regulating isoactin dynamics and cell motility, we transfected endothelial cells (EC) with HA-tagged ARF6: the wild-type form (WT), a constitutively-active form unable to hydrolyze GTP (Q67L), and two dominant-negative forms, which are either unable to release GDP (T27N) or fail to bind nucleotide (N122I). Motility was assessed by digital imaging microscopy before Western blot analysis, coimmunoprecipitation, or colocalization studies using ARF6, β-actin, or β-actin-binding protein-specific antibodies. EC expressing ARF6-Q67L spread and close in vitro wounds at twice the control rates. EC expressing dominant-negative ARF6 fail to develop a leading edge, are unable to ruffle their membranes (N122I), and possess arborized processes. Colocalization studies reveal that the Q67L and WT ARF6-HA are enriched at the leading edge with β-actin; but T27N and N122I ARF6-HA are localized on endosomes together with the β-actin capping protein, βcap73. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses reveal the direct association of ARF6-HA with βcap73, defining a role for ARF6 in signaling cytoskeletal remodeling during motility. Knowledge of the role that ARF6 plays in orchestrating membrane and β-actin dynamics will help to reveal molecular mechanisms regulating actin-based motility during development and disease. TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES INTRODUCTION Coordination of membrane and isoactin cytoskeletal dynamics represents a critical interface in orchestrating the site-specific delivery of subcellular constituents as well as directing cellular locomotion. For example, signaling through phosphoinositides and Ras family small GTPases has been implicated as pivotal in stimulating actin cytoskeletal reorganization and plasma membrane remodeling during cell motility (Qualmann and Kessels, 2002 ). Phosphoinositides not only regulate the ability of profilins to enhance nucleotide exchange on actin, they can cause actin dissociation from profilin (Yin and Janmey, 2002 ). Phosphoinositides can also cause the dissociation of capping proteins from the barbed ends of actin filaments at the membrane, permitting filament assembly and elongation. The ability of phosphoinositides to influence cytoskeletal dynamics in a significant way is conferred by their binding affinity for so many important cytoskeletal signaling molecules, such as members of the Rho GTPase family. Despite the fact that the Rho GTPase family of signaling proteins has been shown to modulate cytoskeletal remodeling during developmental or disease-related processes (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002 ), the molecular mechanisms regulating the interactions of these proteins with the actin cytoskeleton have not been clearly defined. The best-characterized members of this large family are Rho, Rac, and CDC42, which signal through the actin network to regulate the assembly of stress fibers (Ridley and Hall, 1992 ), lamellopodia (Ridley et al., 1992 ), and filopodia (Kozma et al., 1995 ; Brown et al., 2000 ), respectively. Recently, it has been revealed that the Rho GTPase family may signal through the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family to effect cytoskeletal remodeling during cell motility (Zhang et al., 1999 ; Santy and Casanova, 2001 ; Tarricone et al., 2001 ). In fact, ARF6 plays a dual role in regulating both actin cytoskeletal and plasma membrane dynamics. It also colocalizes with Rac1 on endosomes, and the two are simultaneously transported to the plasma membrane during motility (Boshans et al., 2000 ). Both Rac1 and ARF6 have nucleotide-dependent interactions with the Arfaptin and Arfophilin proteins (Shin et al., 2001 ), which may play a role in their colocalization and transport linkage. The localization of ARF6 is nucleotide dependent; in its GDP-bound form, it has been localized to the cytosol and to endosomal compartments, and when bound to GTP, it becomes localized to the plasma membrane (Gaschet and Hsu, 1999 ) with ARNO, its specific nucleotide exchange factor (Frank et al., 1998 ; Santy and Casanova, 2001 ). ARF6, Rac1, and Rho have all been shown to activate PIP-5-kinase (Brown et al., 2001 ), an enzyme that generates PI-4,5 biphosphate, though only ARF6-GTP and Rac1 do so directly (Tolias et al., 2000 ). This enzyme, in turn, can aid actin cytoskeletal remodeling and cell motility by unmasking the barbed ends of actin filaments capped by gelsolin (Carlier, 1998 ; Pollard and Borisy, 2003 ). The dendritic nucleation hypothesis has recently been put forward to explain the mechanisms regulating actin assembly during motility (Machesky et al., 1999 ; Svitkina and Borisy, 1999 ; Blanchoin et al., 2000 ; Amann and Pollard, 2001 ). This hypothesis states that actin assembly and branching occurs by ARP2/3 actin nucleation, which is activated by WASP, on the sides of older actin filaments. Profilin and capping proteins function to limit the length of new actin filaments, favoring a branched assembly. Along with actin-depolymerizing factor, cofilin, these proteins provide a dynamic framework to explain actin filament assembly and turnover during motility. However, this hypothesis neither explains the physical nature of the association of the terminal actin network with the plasma membrane, nor does it address the functional diversity of the cellular isoactin network itself (Herman, 1993 ; Khaitlina, 2001 ). Indeed, despite the highly conserved nature of the actin multigene family, there is considerable evidence indicating that the actin isoforms are functionally distinct. With respect to actin-based cell motility, we have recently revealed the important role of β-actin and its isoform-specific barbed end capping protein, βcap73 (Shuster, 1995 ; Shuster et al., 1996 ; Welch and Herman, 2002 ). In our experiments, we have sought to elucidate the role of ARF6 in coordinating cell motility through β-actin dynamics and membrane trafficking, using an in vitro model of wound healing. Transient transfection of HA-tagged wild-type and mutant forms of ARF6 into vascular endothelial cells together with analysis of living cell migration in response to injury help to reveal the cellular behavior as a function of ARF6 expression. In turn, colocalization studies demonstrate that dominant-negative ARF6-HA proteins (T27N and N122I) colocalize with βcap73 and early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA-1) in abnormal endosomal compartments, whereas the dominant-positive and wild-type forms predominantly colocalize with β-actin at the leading edge of motile cells. Endothelial cells expressing Q67L dominantpositive ARF6-HA spread at twice the rate of untransfected cells in time-lapse wound healing assays. Most interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting reveal the direct association of ARF6 with βcap73. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the association of ARF6 with βcap73 may play a pivotal role in regulating β-actin and membrane dynamics during cell motility. TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture All of our experiments were performed on bovine retinal endothelial cells. For time-lapse imaging and indirect immunofluorescence, cells were plated on 10-mm2 glass coverslips in Costar 24-well plates, at a density of 100,000 cells per well, to reach ~80% confluence 24 h after plating. All cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum and 0.5% each L-glutamine and penicillin-streptomycin-fungizone. Transfection Transfection was carried out with the Effectene reagent kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), using 0.2 μg of DNA per coverslip. DNA prepared with Effectene was diluted in complete media and applied to cell populations ~24 h after plating, when cultures had reached ~80% confluence. These cultures were incubated for 24 h in the reagent, then washed with PBS, and fed with fresh media. Cells were transfected with plasmids for expression of ARF6 proteins with HA tags. Plasmids were engineered for wild-type ARF6; a dominant-negative, GTP binding-defective mutant, T27N; and a constitutively active, GTP hydrolysis-defective mutant, Q67L. Another HA-tagged ARF6 mutant, which is completely incapable of binding nucleotide, N122I, was a generous gift of Dr. Ralph Isberg (Tufts University. ) Time-lapse Imaging Twenty-four to 30 h after transfection, coverslips were mounted for time-lapse imaging. Transfected monolayers, with cells attached to coverslips, were injured with a razor blade to remove half of the monolayer and then mounted in the specially designed cell culture chamber, which maintains physiological pH. The cell culture chamber was placed on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope (40× objective, NA = 0.75; Thornwood, NY) and kept at 37°C using an air curtain (Nevtek, Burnsville, VA). A target field along the wound edge was selected and phase-contrast images were captured every 5 min using the Metamorph software package (Universal Imaging Corp. , Downingtown, PA) After imaging, the coverslips with cells attached were removed from the chamber and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Image Analysis Rate of cell motility was determined by analyzing multiple images from several experiments of the time-lapse series (n ≥ 30), using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 (San Jose, CA). In each image, the space devoid of cells was measured in pixels and then converted to square micrometers. The difference in empty area between each pair of images was calculated and then divided by the elapsed time to give a rate of movement: Equation We also analyzed the behavior of single cells within and between experimental groups. Translocation of the cell was measured by selecting a feature of the nucleus and tracking its X and Y coordinates in each frame. This was converted to a linear measurement in micrometers (Metamorph, Universal Imaging Co.) Spreading was also measured, by selecting each cell around its border and converting this area measurement into square micrometers (Photoshop, Adobe. ) Indirect Immunofluorescence Twenty-four to 36 h after transfection, cells on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in DMEM and permeablized for 90 s at room temperature with buffered Triton X-100 as described (Hoock et al., 1991 ). Coverslips were then incubated for 45 min in the specified primary antibodies diluted in PBS/azide, followed by the corresponding secondary antibodies for 45 min. Coverslips were mounted using the SlowFade Light Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were imaged using the same microscope setup as described above for time-lapse imaging. Antibodies Primary antibodies for immunofluorescence and Western blotting are anti-βcap73 (murine monoclonal IgM) and anti-β-actin (affinity-selected, rabbit polyclonal IgG), rat monoclonal anti-HA IgG (Boehringer Mannheim via Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), and anti-ARF6 (3F8, monoclonal IgG; Yang et al., 1998 ). Secondary antibodies are Alexa 488– and 546–conjugated antibodies from Molecular Probes and FITC- and TRITC-conjugated antibodies from Jackson Immunofluorescence (West Grove, PA.) For all immunofluorescence experiments, several controls were performed. Working dilutions (1:100–1:500) of labeled secondary antibodies were tested for background fluorescence and nonspecific binding, which were not detectable. For these controls, cells were fixed and permeablized under standard test conditions, but the primary antibodies were omitted. In addition, to test for cross-species and cross-isotype reactivities, all secondary antibodies were examined for their ability to combine with primary antibodies, as viewed by immunofluorescence and where applicable, Western blotting. To establish that each commercially available secondary antibody used recognized only its cognate primary antibody, secondary antibodies were tested with primary antibodies generated from a different species. For example, we confirmed that the FITC goat anti-rat IgG cross-reacted with rat IgG, but not with rabbit IgG. This was especially critical when simultaneous double immunofluorescence was performed on the same specimen. In this way, each pair of primary-secondary antibodies was tested to check for cross-species reactivity. Additionally, localization patterns obtained during colocalization studies were compared with results obtained when only a single antigen was being localized. In all cases, results from single and double immunofluorescence were consistent. Immunoprecipitation Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously described (Witczak et al., 1999 ; Welch and Herman, 2002 ). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40 and then incubated 10 min at room temperature in presence of protease inhibitors. Approximately 10 μg of anti-HA primary antibody was incubated with 10 μl of packed protein A/Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rotation. Meanwhile, 250 μl of lysate (~400 μg protein) was precleared with 10 μl of protein A/Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature. The precleared lysate was then incubated with antibody-protein A/Sepharose complex overnight at 4°C with gentle rotation. The beads were washed five times in RIPA buffer and one time in buffer containing 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 50 mM NaCl. The beads were then boiled in 50 μl of 1× sample buffer for 3 min, and the supernatant was run on SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting Samples (cell lysate or immunoprecipitate) were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 3 min before loading on 1.5-mm-thick polyacrylamide slab gels containing 0.1% SDS. The samples were separated by electrophoresis and were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) overnight at 200 mA in a Tris-buffered methanol/SDS solution. Western blotting was performed as described by Amersham (Piscataway, NJ). Briefly, blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) for at least 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. For immunodetection, the blots were incubated with primary antibody at ~5 μg/ml for at least 2 h at room temperature and incubated 1 h in ~ 0.4 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit or anti-rat IgG HRP. Detection was performed with Supersignal Western detection reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Images of stained gels were recorded with a model IS-1000 digital imager (Alpha Inotech, San Leandro, CA). TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES RESULTS Expression of Mutant ARF6 in Vascular Endothelial Cells: Role in Regulating Motility To investigate the role of ARF6 in regulating membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics, we transiently transfected microvascular endothelial cells with plasmids encoding HA-tagged wild-type and mutant ARF6. ARF6-HA expression was confirmed by Western blotting of whole cell lysates from i) untreated populations, ii) populations exposed to the Effectene transfection reagent without plasmid DNA, and iii) those transfected with each of the ARF6-HA expression plasmids (Figure 1). The blot was probed with anti-ARF6 (3F8), revealing the 20-kDa endogenous ARF6 in all cell populations and the 21-kDa HA-tagged ARF6 in the transfected populations. Results reveal that our transfection is successful and that the various ARF6 mutant proteins are being comparably expressed. To assess the influence of mutant ARF6 expression on cell motility, we quantified endothelial cell migration over a 2-h period in response to injury. We have compared the behavior of entire populations as well as individual cells. In populations transfected with the Q67L (dominant-active) ARF6 mutant, the leading edge advances at approximately twice the rate seen in untransfected control populations or those transfected with wild-type, T27N, or N122I plasmids (Figure 2). The cells at the leading edges of the Q67L-transfected populations generally display a smooth, broad lamellar fan and form a relatively contiguous leading edge. The leading edges of control and wild-type transfected populations also appear smooth and contiguous, though they do not ruffle and advance as quickly as those of the Q67L populations. Although the overall motility rates of the T27N and N122I ARF6-expressing populations are not significantly different from those of the untransfected controls or wild-type transfected populations, there are observable alterations in cell morphology and motility. Populations expressing either of the dominant-negative proteins fail to form a smooth, ruffled leading edge. Some cells do not appear to ruffle their membranes at all, producing gaps in the advancing edge, whereas other cells produce narrow, elongated pseudopodia instead of a broad membrane fan. ARF6-HA Antibody Localization To further investigate how altered motility and ability to establish membrane projections is related to the form and distribution of ARF6, we performed antibody localization in cells whose motility had been recorded in time-lapse. After transfection and time-lapse imaging, cells were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence to localize ARF6-HA, in conjunction with β-actin and βcap73. In the samples analyzed by time-lapse imaging, recorded fields were relocated after fixation and staining and transfected cells along the wound edge were identified by robust anti-HA staining (Figure 3). Generally, between 15 and 50% of the cells in a transfected population highly express the HA-tagged ARF6. With the T27N mutant, efficiency is slightly lower. Individual cells expressing the Q67L ARF6 mutant spread to as much as 200% of their original size, whereas neighboring untransfected cells and cells from untransfected populations spread to a maximum of 130% of their original size, with an average maximum of 115% among the control cells examined. No significant difference was found in the cell migration rates (measured by nuclear translocation) of individual transfected cells, as compared with controls, with any of the ARF6-HA plasmids. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to compare the localization of the wild-type with the mutant ARF6-HA proteins (Figure 4). In the Q67L ARF6 expressing cells, ARF6-HA is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, with increased localization in membrane veils at the leading edge of crawling cells located at the in vitro wound edge. In some cells, small punctae are present, suggesting the association of some ARF6 molecules with endosomes. These Q67L-expressing cells possess large lamellar fans, consistent with the spreading seen in the individual cells analyzed in time-lapse. In cells expressing the wild-type form, cytoplasmic distribution and small endosomal pools are also seen, with increased concentration at the leading edge, though less than that seen in the Q67L-expressers. Cell morphology in wild-type transfectants is similar to that of neighboring unstained cells. The dominant-negative forms of ARF6, T27N, and N122I show a localization pattern quite different from the wild-type and dominant-positive forms. The majority of the tagged protein is seen in abnormally large endosomes, with little or no cytoplasmic or leading edge localization. The distribution of these endosomes does not resemble that of any recognizable structure such as the Golgi complex, because they are spread throughout the central area of the cell. The morphology of these cells is clearly affected; they fail to develop a smooth lamellar fan, instead displaying narrower, branched projections or a blunted, immobile leading edge. In all endothelial cells examined, β-actin is present at the cell periphery and is strongly concentrated at the leading edge together with βcap73 (Welch and Herman, 2002 ). In the wild-type and Q67L ARF6-HA–expressing cells, these concentrations of β-actin colocalize with areas of enrichment of ARF6-HA at the leading edge. The absence of dominant-negative ARF6 from the cell periphery does not appear to alter β-actin localization. Colocalization of Dominant-Negative ARF6 with EEA-1 After our observation of the concentration of dominant-negative ARF6 on endosomes, we stained transfected endothelial cell populations for a variety of endosomal markers, in an attempt to determine if a specific type of intracellular compartment was affected. Through these experiments, we found that the endosomes in which the mutant ARF6 is seen generally also contain early endosomal antigen-1 (EEA-1, Figure 5). Other antibodies tested include those against TGN38 and Rab11, proteins associated with membrane trafficking within and from the Golgi complex. None of the antibodies tested showed colocalization with any form of ARF6 except for EEA-1. βcap73 Coimmunoprecipitates with ARF6 β-actin assembly is critical for projection formation and cell motility and occurs primarily at the leading edge of motile cells. A barbed-end capping protein specific for β-actin, βcap73, has been found, and has been shown to regulate this assembly. As we have seen that β-actin colocalizes with wild-type and dominant-positive ARF6 at the leading edge, we wanted to determine whether mutant ARF6 modulation of motility might be the result of the direct association with βcap73. Indirect immunofluorescence reveals that a subpopulation of βcap73 colocalizes strongly with the dominant-negative ARF6-HA mutants within the endosomal compartment (Figure 6). This endosomal colocalization was not observed in the wild-type or Q67L-expressers. To determine whether βcap73 and ARF6 interact directly, immunoprecipitation was performed on endothelial cell populations transfected with each of the ARF6 plasmids, using the monoclonal rat anti-HA antibody to “pull down” the ectopic ARF6 proteins, together with any binding partners. The resulting product was probed via Western blot with anti-βcap73 IgM, and with the anti-HA antibody for comparison (Figure 7). Results reveal that βcap73 binds directly to all forms of HA-tagged ARF6. Levels of βcap73 bound to the wild-type protein and the Q67L and T27N mutants are comparable. Interestingly, the nucleotide binding-impaired N122I mutant precipitates four times the level of βcap73, as analyzed by spot densitometry. TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES DISCUSSION Our results, in conjunction with the published findings of others, support a central role for ARF6 in the coordination of plasma membrane recycling and actin cytoskeletal remodeling, but extend these observations by revealing the association of ARF6 with the β-actin network via βcap73. We find that overexpression of dominant-positive ARF6 increases endothelial cell motility, primarily by inducing increased spreading at the leading edge, where active ARF6 colocalizes with β-actin. ARF6 inactivation, studied through overexpression of dominant-negative mutants, results in impaired spreading and a blunted or arborized leading edge. Most importantly, we have shown a direct link to the β-actin cytoskeleton through βcap73, a novel, β-actin–specific barbed end capping protein. Localization of ARF6 The information gathered by overexpression of ARF6 followed by indirect immunofluorescence labeling confirms that ARF6 is important for regulating traffic between the early and recycling endosomes and the plasma membrane. Wild-type and Q67L ARF6 appear to move efficiently from the interior of the cell to the plasma membrane; both forms are concentrated at the leading edge of motile cells. This is consistent with findings that GTP-bound ARF6 is localized to the plasma membrane in other cell types (Gaschet and Hsu, 1999 ). Colocalized with the dominant-positive and wild-type forms at the leading edge is β-actin, the actin isoform known to be important for cell motility (Hoock et al., 1991 ). In contrast, the dominant-negative T27N and N122I mutants become trapped in abnormally large early or recycling endosome pools, colocalized with βcap73. Immunoprecipitation assays reveal that βcap73 and ARF6 interact directly. Regulation of Isoactin Dynamics during Cell Motility and Spreading The association of ARF6 with β-actin-capping protein βcap73 reveals a direct role in signaling cytoskeletal remodeling during motility. The availability of barbed ends of β-actin filaments for assembly is clearly critical for spreading and motility. Through its binding to βcap73, ARF6 may be able to regulate the binding affinity of βcap73 for β-actin at its known β-actin binding domain, and perhaps remove it from the active peripheral zone to the recycling endosome, thus altering β-actin polymerization kinetics. Through its activation of PIP-5-kinase and the subsequent generation of PI-4,5 biphosphate, ARF6 may be able to decrease the binding affinity of βcap73 for β-actin, because PI-4,5 biphosphate has been shown dissociate capping protein gelsolin from F-actin (Schafer et al., 1996 ). This dissociation may be the necessary first step for ARF6 to transport βcap73 to the recycling endosome. The exact relationship among the molecules in the plasma membrane-associated actin-binding complex is unclear, but βcap73 is obviously well positioned to have a significant effect on β-actin dynamics and cell motility through its association with ARF6. In fact, cells overexpressing the calpain inhibitor calpastatin have a phenotype similar to some of the ARF6 dominant-negative–expressing cells: deficient motility, aberrant projection formation, and abnormal cell shape. Indeed, these cells have been found to have an overabundance of βcap73 that is 10 times that of their wild-type parental cells (Welch and Herman, 2002 ). Furthermore, overexpression of transfected βcap73 causes cellular processes that are arborized and β-actin rich, similar to the morphology seen in cells overexpressing dominant-negative ARF6. ARF6 and Membrane Recycling Efficient membrane recycling and timely delivery of subcellular components is necessary for cell motility. The importance of ARF6 in this process is evidenced by the increased motility seen with the Q67L dominant-positive mutant in the time-lapse assay. The same dominant-positive mutant has also been found to stimulate migration in epithelial cells (Palacios et al., 2001 ). Activation of ARF6 by its exchange factor, ARNO, is sufficient to promote this epithelial migration (Santy and Casanova, 2001 ). ARF6 has already been implicated in membrane recycling and exocytosis in epithelial (D'Souza-Schorey et al., 1998 ) and neural cells, evidence which, taken together, supports our model of ARF6 as a regulator of endosome recycling in endothelial cells. Clearly, understanding the role of ARF6 in regulating membrane and isoactin dynamics should prove instrumental in revealing the mechanics of cell motility.

Top Abstract Background Methods Results Discussion Conclusions Author Contributions References Abstract Background The Quality of Life Scale (QOLS), developed originally by John Flanagan in the 1970's, has been adapted for use in chronic illness groups. Evidence for reliability and validity has been published over the years for both English and translations. This paper presents further evidence of construct validity for persons with chronic conditions as well as across two languages, and gender. Methods A sample of 1241 chronically ill and healthy adults from American and Swedish databases was used to generate factor analyses for both the 15-item original QOLS and the 16-item chronic illness adaptation. Results Analysis of the data suggested that the QOLS has three factors in the healthy sample and across chronic conditions, two languages and gender. Factors that could be labeled (1) Relationships and Material Well-Being, (2) Health and Functioning, and (3) Personal, Social and Community Commitment were identified. Conclusions The QOLS is a valid instrument for measuring domains of quality of life across diverse patient groups. Top Abstract Background Methods Results Discussion Conclusions Author Contributions References Background Quality of life (QOL) measures have become a vital and often required part of health outcome appraisal. For populations with chronic disease, measurement of QOL provides a meaningful way to determine the impact of health care when cure is not possible. Hundreds of instruments have been developed to measure QOL [1]. Many of these instruments measure only health-related aspects of QOL such as functional status, symptoms, disease processes, or treatment side effects. As such they are useful as treatment outcome measures but may not cover the wide-range of domains that are important to an individual's life. The Flanagan Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) takes this issue into account [2,3]. The QOLS was developed in the United States during the 1970's to measure the quality of life across a random sampling of 3000 American adults using an interview technique. In a second step, Flanagan used the instrument to survey a total of 3,000 people, ages 30, 50, and 70. The results of this national survey revealed that most people of both genders and all three ages felt that the items were important to them. The original QOLS contained 15 items representing 5 conceptual domains of QOL: physical and material well being, relationships with other people, social and civic activities, personal development, and recreation (Table 1). However, Flanagan believed that some adaptations for persons with chronic conditions or disabilities might be needed and that different rating scales might produce divergent results [3]. In 1981 he gave the first author permission to adapt the scale if necessary for patients with chronic illness. A study of content validity of the QOLS, in which Americans with chronic illness were asked open-ended questions about what the term "quality of life" meant to them and what was important to their QOL, generated words and phrases that were very similar to those used by the general population that Flanagan had studied [4]. However, they also generated a list of phrases that could be best described as "efforts to remain independent" using words and phrases, such as "independence" and "able to care for myself. " This concept was added to the QOLS as a 16th item – Independence, ability to do for oneself as the only adaptation of item content. Over the ensuing 20 years, several researchers have used the 16-item English language adapted version of the QOLS as well as translations of the QOLS to gather quantitative QOL information from people with chronic illnesses and healthy samples. These illnesses include diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, and post-ostomy surgery patients [4], rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [4-6], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [7], fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS [8,9], psoriasis [10], heart disease [11], spinal cord injury [12], and low back pain [13]. Flanagan did not report psychometric data in his instrument development work. Estimates from the first study of 240 American patients with chronic illness indicated that the 15-item QOLS satisfaction scale as one scale containing all 15 items was internally consistent (α = .82 to .92) and had high test-retest reliability over 3 weeks in stable chronic illness groups (r = 0.78 to r = 0 .84) [4]. Researchers have reported similar reliability estimates in translations of the QOLS that have been made in Swedish [6], Hebrew [9], Norwegian [10] and Mandarin Chinese [12]. Content validity work on the Swedish version of the QOLS has also suggested that the items are valid in the Swedish population [14]. Convergent and discriminant construct validity of the QOLS in chronic illness groups was evidenced first by the high correlations between the QOLS total score and the Life Satisfaction Index-Z (LSI-Z) [15] (r = 0.67 to 0.75) and its low to moderate correlations with the physical health status subscale (r = 0.25 to 0.48) from the Duke-UNC Health Profile [16] and a disease impact measure, the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) [17] (r = 0.28 to 0.44) [4]. Later evidence that the QOLS could discriminate levels of QOL in populations that would be expected to differ emerged. A group of healthy adults as well as groups with more stable chronic illnesses, such as post-ostomy surgery, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, were shown to have significantly higher scores than groups of patients with the persistent painful condition, fibromyalgia, life-threatening COPD, or insulin-dependent diabetes [18]. Although Flanagan conceptually defined 5 major categories within which the 15 items of his scale could be placed, no factor analysis work was ever published to confirm those categories. Therefore, our aim was to determine whether a stable factor structure existed within the scale. This would provide additional evidence for construct validity. The purpose of this paper is to report the results of analyses that focused on determining whether the conceptual categories proposed by Flanagan are present in empirical data or whether a different conceptual model of the instrument is more appropriate. The validity of the model across chronic conditions, translations, and gender was also tested as a way of determining the generalizability of the instrument. Top Abstract Background Methods Results Discussion Conclusions Author Contributions References Methods Design The study used secondary analysis of a database developed from American and Swedish persons with chronic illnesses and a healthy comparison group from both countries. All projects from which the database were derived had been approved by the appropriate institutional review board or ethical committee for the protection of human subjects. Subjects The subjects for these analyses were drawn from the database maintained by the first author. It contained 922 adults with chronic illnesses and 319 healthy comparison subjects. Sample 1 319 healthy men and women, 269 drawn from a random sample of Swedish adults and 50 volunteers drawn from an educational facility in the United States. Sample 2 584 adult men and women outpatients from the specialty clinics of a large health sciences university in the United States. Diagnoses of the patients were: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 181), osteoarthritis (n = 98), lupus and other rheumatic diseases (n = 48), diabetes mellitus (n = 60), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 60), post-ostomy surgery (n = 61), fibromyalgia (n = 76). Sample 3 170 adult women outpatients from the rheumatology clinic of a university hospital in Sweden. Diagnoses of these patients were: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 50), lupus (n = 50), fibromyalgia (n = 20). Sample 4 168 adult men and women outpatients with COPD drawn from two private pulmonary specialty practices in the United States. The demographic characteristics of these samples are shown in Table 2. Instrument The Flanagan QOLS [2] used a five-point likert-type scale that measured "satisfaction with needs met. " No reliability of this scaling was reported at the time. Earlier work by Andrews and Crandall [19] had suggested that a 7-point scale anchored with the words "delighted" and "terrible" was more sensitive and less negatively skewed than a 5-point satisfaction scale for quality of life assessment. The seven responses were "delighted" (7), "pleased" (6), "mostly satisfied" (5), "mixed" (4), "mostly dissatisfied" (3), "unhappy" (2), "terrible" (1). For the English language work reported here, the 7-point delighted-terrible scale was used to measure satisfaction. A 7-point satisfaction scale anchored with "very satisfied" and "very dissatisfied" was used in the Swedish samples because the delighted-terrible scaling could not be made meaningful in Swedish [6]. The amount of skewness in the items did not differ despite the differences in wording (Unpublished data). In this study, both the 15-item QOLS and the 16-item QOLS with the independence item added were analyzed. Data Analysis Exploratory principal components analysis with orthogonal rotation was used to develop the factor model. Conceptual categories originally described by Flanagan were considered to be independent of each other. Examination of scree plots of eigenvalues was used to determine the number of factors to be retained in each analysis. The default eigenvalue of 1.0 was used. Variables within factors with loadings of .40 or above were considered to be significantly related to the factor and retained [20]. In all five exploratory analyses were carried out. Because the QOLS had been developed originally from the work on a healthy population, the first exploratory analysis on the 15-item QOLS was carried out with the healthy American and Swedish sample. Then, the sample of 584 Americans with chronic illness was subjected to the exploratory analysis. After those samples were analyzed, the sample of 170 Swedes with chronic illness was analyzed to determine the factor structure in the Swedish version of the QOLS. Finally, two further analyses in which the samples above were combined with another 168 subjects with COPD were run by gender using the 16 item QOLS. Top Abstract Background Methods Results Discussion Conclusions Author Contributions References Results As seen in Table 3, the first analysis on the healthy sample yielded a 3-factor solution composed of a first factor that contained all 4 relationship items (#3,4,5,6) from Flanagan's conceptual category of relationships with other people and the socializing (#13) and passive recreation (#14) items from the recreation category. The second factor combined Flanagan's conceptual category of physical and material well being (#1,2) with occupational role (#11) from the personal development and fulfillment category and active recreation (#15) from the recreation category. The third factor combined the social, community, and civic activities conceptual category items (#7,8) with 3 of the personal development and fulfillment items (#9,10,12). Activities related to helping others (#7) was considered complex as it loaded significantly on more than one factor. In the second factor analysis in which the Americans with chronic illness were studied (Table 4), the first factor was composed of all the items in the social, community and civic activities category (#7,8), 3 of the 4 items in personal development and fulfillment (#9,10,12) as well as 2 items from recreation (#13,14). The second factor was composed of 3 items of health (#2), occupational role (#11) and active recreation (#15). The third factor contained 5 items, material well being (#1) and all four relationship items (#3,4,5,6). The third factor analysis, run on the Swedish version of the QOLS, also yielded a 3-factor solution resembling the American chronic illness sample results in its factor structure (Table 4). All items in the Swedish sample loaded on the same factors as the American sample, with the exception of relationship with relatives, which loaded on Factor 3 in the American sample, and on Factor 1 in the Swedish sample. Three items in these two sample loaded on more than one factor. These were item #13 – socializing, in the American sample and #3, relationship with relatives, and #6, having close friends, in the Swedish sample. Finally, two exploratory factor analyses were run by gender. In all there were 888 women and 353 men. These analyses also yielded three-factor solutions (Table 5). Results for the sample of women were identical to the American chronic illness sample factor analysis, with item 16, independence, loading on the factor containing health, work and active recreation. For men, all items that loaded on a factor were the same as in the American sample also. However, one item, socializing (#13) loaded on two factors while material well-being (#1) and passive recreation (#14) did not load significantly on any factor. Top Abstract Background Methods Results Discussion Conclusions Author Contributions References Discussion From earlier work, it is evident that the QOLS is a reliable instrument for measuring quality of life from the perspective of the patient. Evidence of convergent and discriminant construct validity has also been provided previously [4]. The factor analyses described here provide additional indications for construct validity of the scale. The QOLS has a fairly stable factor structure across samples that are diverse in health, culture, and gender. Twelve of the 16 items loaded consistently with the same items on three factors in all five exploratory analyses. Differences between the healthy sample and the two chronic illness samples were minimal. Material well-being (#1) loaded with the health, work and active recreation items in the healthy sample and with the relationship items in the chronic illness samples. Other than that difference, there were no other clear differences in the factor structures of the three samples. Four items (#3, relationship with relatives; # 6, having close friends; #7, helping others; and #13, socializing) loaded significantly on two different factors in one or the other of the three samples. All of these items can easily be seen as relating to either personal relationships or to the broader relationships one has with a larger social group. As such, they are complex variables that should be more clearly worded in any revision of the QOLS in order to place them more accurately within one or the other factor. Flanagan's developmental work led him to conceptualize the 15 items of importance to people's quality of life in five categories (Table 1). The three factor structure that emerged from these more recent analyses is overall consistent with Flanagan's conceptualization in that two of the factors are essentially combinations of Flanagan's categories All of Flanagan's relationship items loaded on a single factor, along with material well-being and financial security. This factor was named Relationships and Material Well-being. Others have established the preeminence of personal relationships in peoples' judgments of their quality of life [21]. Thus, it is not surprising that the relationship items loaded together. The loading of material well-being on this factor was unexpected, since material well-being does not seem, at first glance, to be conceptually related to relationships. In early social science research [22], the objective conditions of life (financial security and the material goods money can buy) were not related to quality of life perceptions, so loading of this item with relationships (which are known to be very important to quality of life) was not initially expected. Perhaps both material well-being and close personal relationships are related to a sense of security that people interpret as central to quality of life. The second factor, here named Personal, Social, and Community Commitment includes items related to personal expression, as well as meaningful involvement in the lives of others and society at large. This factor essentially collapsed two of Flanagan's conceptual categories into one. Development of the intellect and understanding the self are extended to nurturing the development of others and participation in civic life, all of which provide different kinds of satisfaction the close personal relationships found in the Relationship and Material Well-being factor. The unique faactor that emerged from the analyses was composed of three items related to health and functional activity (health, occupational role, and active recreation,) here named Health and Functioning. This factor drew on items from three of Flanagan's conceptual categories and in the 16-item QOLS analysis, the independence item loaded on this factor as well. It is likely that in today's society with its concomitant trends of longevity and public acknowledgment of the benefits of physical activity, people link the idea of health with unrestricted physical functioning and role performance. It is important to note also that the independence item that was added to the original Flanagan instrument is strongly and consistently related to the other three items in this factor. Therefore, it is clearly relevant to the quality of life of chronically ill people. Two items, material well-being and passive recreation, did not load on any factor in the male sample. Low correlations or factor loadings of variables with identified factors may mean that the items are unreliable or outliers in the particular sample that was factor analyzed. No statistical explanation for the low factor loadings was found as the variables were not abnormally skewed or lacking in variance. It may be that for the men in this sample, material well-being and passive recreation were not relavent to their concept of life quality and thus, did not correlate with the other items. Strengths of this study include the large data sets available for testing, the diversity of the samples with regard to age, health status, work status, culture, and gender. Because the three-factor solution was consistent across three samples, it may be useful to make subscale scores of the instrument. One might expect that the Health and Functioning factor would change as a result of various treatment strategies. It also seems likely that the Relationships and Material Well-being factor could change in a positive direction as a result of strategies specifically designed to assist persons with chronic illness to return to work and active roles. We suggest that the socializing item (#13) which was conceptually complex be placed in the Personal, Social and Community Commitment factor and that the relationship with relatives (#3) and having close friends (#6) remain in the Relationship and Material Well-Being factor. Limitations of this work are that the majority of subjects were white females who, based on education level, were from the middle class. Additional samples including larger proportions of men, non-whites, and people of different socioeconomic classes are needed to provide additional evidence for instrument validity in these populations.

Top sidebar menu small square Abstract Background Results Discussion Conclusions Methods Authors' contributions Supplementary Material References Abstract Background Direct observations of underwater behaviour of free-living marine mammals are rare. This is particularly true for large and potentially dangerous species such as the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus). Walruses are highly specialised predators on benthic invertebrates &#x02013; especially bivalves. The unique feeding niche of walruses has led to speculations as to their underwater foraging behaviour. Based on observations of walruses in captivity and signs of predation left on the sea floor by free-living walruses, various types of feeding behaviour have been suggested in the literature. In this study, however, the underwater feeding behaviour of wild adult male Atlantic walruses (O. r. rosmarus) is documented for the first time in their natural habitat by scuba-divers. The video recordings indicated a predisposition for use of the right front flipper during feeding. This tendency towards dextrality was explored further by examining a museum collection of extremities of walrus skeletons. Results During July and August 2001, twelve video-recordings of foraging adult male walruses were made in Young Sound (74&#x000b0;18 N; 20&#x000b0;15 V), Northeast Greenland. The recordings did not allow for differentiation among animals, however based on notes by the photographer at least five different individuals were involved. The walruses showed four different foraging behaviours; removing sediment by beating the right flipper, removing sediment by beating the left flipper, removing sediment by use of a water-jet from the mouth and rooting through sediment with the muzzle. There was a significant preference for using right flipper over left flipper during foraging. Measurements of the dimensions of forelimbs from 23 walrus skeletons revealed that the length of the right scapula, humerus, and ulna was significantly greater than that of the left, supporting our field observations of walruses showing a tendency of dextrality in flipper use. Conclusion We suggest that the four feeding behaviours observed are typical of walruses in general, although walruses in other parts of their range may have evolved other types of feeding behaviour. While based on small sample sizes both the underwater observations and skeletal measurements suggest lateralized limb use, which is the first time this has been reported in a pinniped. Top Abstract sidebar menu small square Background Results Discussion Conclusions Methods Authors' contributions Supplementary Material References Background Walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) are highly specialised benthic feeders feeding almost exclusively on bivalves, making them an important component of the benthic ecosystem [1-4]. It is mainly the soft parts of the bivalves that are found in walrus stomachs, with pieces of shells seen only rarely [1,2]. Almost 6400 bivalve siphons have been reported in a single walrus stomach [2]. This feeding pattern makes walruses unique among pinnipeds, and has led to different theories as to how the walruses are able to locate and excavate their benthic prey [5-8]. For practical reasons, these theories have been based on the appearance and physical structure of walrus feeding patches on the sea-floor [7], food remains (shells) left on the sea bottom after a walrus feed [6], and on observations of animals in captivity [8]. Indeed Kastelein &#x00026; Mosterd [8] wrote: "Because it is considered dangerous to be in the water with wild walruses, the suggested excavation technique of this species has not been investigated further.". This paper is the first that gives details of the foraging behaviour of free-living Atlantic walrus (O. r. rosmarus) based on close-up underwater video recordings in Northeast Greenland. Young Sound has a stable, recurrent summer population of walruses, predominantly adult males (app. 50 animals, [9]), that take advantage of the area's high mollusc densities. The feeding grounds are accessible to the walruses from ice break-up at the end of July until the formation of new fast-ice in October [9,10]. A sub-goal of a study in Young Sound was to quantify the role of walruses as top-predators in this coastal marine ecosystem [11-13]. A combination of sampling of emptied bivalve shells left by the feeding walruses and satellite-telemetry information on activity were used to calculate the amount of food ingested during a typical foraging trip [14]. Underwater video recordings of feeding walruses were made during the same period. Walrus feeding can be examined in three main ways: (1) Examination of the physical structures that are visible on the sea bottom and remains of food (i.e. empty bivalve shells) after a walrus-feeding event, (2) Quantification of food and energy intake, and (3) Direct observation of the behaviour and techniques used by the walruses when localising and excavating prey. The present study uses the latter approach whereas all previous studies have been confined to the first two e.g. [3,6,14-16]. Based on stomach contents and observations of free-ranging walruses in 1939&#x02013;40, Vibe [1] suggested that the walruses take excavated mussels into their mouths, since discarded mussels often occurred at walruses' breathing holes in the ice, either whole or, more often, as empty shells, but always intact and connected. He further noted that the shells of the preferred prey (the bivalves Mya and Saxicava = Hiatella) are open at the ends and therefore suggested that the walruses suck out the soft parts of the bivalve and discard the empty shells. Kastelein and co-workers made measurements of the suction pressure in the buccal cavity [17] and described the excavation technique used by two captive walruses that were fed molluscs [8,18,19]. These walruses rooted in the bottom of the tank with their snouts and used their vibrissae to locate the prey. They also used their mouths to create a water-jet that removed the bottom sediment, thereby exposing the prey. During the current study, we observed a preference when excavating prey for the use of one flipper over the other. The preferred use of one limb/hand (handedness) to the other is one characteristic of lateralized behaviour [20] as reported extensively for humans [21-24]. In humans, right-handedness (dextrality) is associated with skeletal asymmetries such as a longer humerus, radius and ulna and a heavier scapula on the right-hand side compared to the left [25-28]. This makes the study of morphological asymmetries of the bones of limbs of other species interesting as a prediction of behavioural lateralization. Functional activity is seen as the reason for the lateralized difference in bone size [28,29]. We therefore investigated whether bone dimensions reflected the same preferential use of one front limb in walruses, based on measurements of skeletons. Top Abstract Background sidebar menu small square Results Discussion Conclusions Methods Authors' contributions Supplementary Material References Results Walrus foraging behaviourA total of twelve underwater recordings of foraging walruses were made (Table 1). The walruses were feeding at water depths between 6 and 16 m. The 2.5 hours of digital videotapes of foraging walruses showed very uniform feeding behaviour. 31 dives were defined as bottom sequences; these did not necessarily correspond to complete feeding dives because of the practical limitations associated with video recording under water. The recordings did not always start exactly at the beginning of the feed or terminate when the feed ended at the time of surfacing. While at the bottom, the walruses used different techniques for locating and excavating the bivalves. Based on recorded sequences of the diving and surfacing behaviour, the walruses dived directly to the bottom to feed, and when finished they went straight to the surface for air. Bottom-time averaged 215.8 &#x000b1; 81.3 seconds (n = 31), and transit time 11.3 &#x000b1; 1.7 seconds (n = 4). They stayed almost at the same spot for the whole feeding period, with their tusks resting like a sledge on the bottom. The wear from dragging the front of their tusks along the sediment was clearly visible when observing tusks of animals lying on haul-out. The walrus usually positioned itself facing the current, and with its body at an angle of between 45 and 90 degrees to the sea bottom (although in some situations it kept its body parallel to the sea floor). The hind flippers were used for moving forwards and backwards and the front flippers as stabilisers when not used in feeding. There was a long trail of sediment in the water around and behind the animal. It was possible for the walrus to keep a small area in front of its head clear from stirred up sediment by propelling with a front flipper a stream of clear water down in front of its head to the sediment surface. This was visible in recordings showing the backward movement of particles in small eddies on both sides of the animal. In some recordings the walruses appeared to be using their eyesight; the eyes were actively kept focusing towards the feeding spot often in combination with vigorous use of the vibrissae to provide tactile information. When feeding on the sea floor, the walruses exhibited three different methods of exposing their prey. 1) The walrus used one of its front flippers in a waving motion over the substrate. There are also recordings of the animal resting on the sea floor on one shoulder and using the free flipper to propel water. The pulse of water removed the top layer of muddy sediment, most probably uncovering the siphons or the bodies of the bivalves. The animals kept their muzzles close to the sea floor during the whole feeding period. Hence, the actual treatment of the prey (i.e. picking it from the sediment, the suction of meat from bivalves or spitting out of emptied valves) could not be seen. However, when collecting the empty mussels after a foraging dive, shells contained 2&#x02013;3% of the original soft tissue attached, e.g. siphon sheath and other remnants of soft parts, indicating that the animal sucks out the soft tissue and leaves the shells behind [14] (Figure 1). (Additional file 1: Video clip 1. Walrus using its flippers and muzzle to expose bivalves). 2) By use of its very sensitive vibrissae [30,31] the walrus felt its way through the top-layer of the sediment likely detecting the bivalve siphons. It then rooted with its snout in the sediment like a pig in the ground (Figure 2). When using the snout, both hind flippers would rest on the sea bottom. (Additional file 2: Video clip 2. Walrus using its vibrissae to detect prey). 3) The walrus squirted a water-jet from its mouth into the sediment. This created enough turbulence to stir up the sediment, thereby likely exposing the bivalves. (Additional file 3: Video clip 3. Walrus feeding with water-jet). There was no significant difference between walrus video recording number 1&#x02013;12 (Table 2) in the proportion of sequence counts in the behaviour categories "flipper use" and "water-jet and muzzle use" (&#x003c7;2 = 2.8; DF = 8; P = 0.99). When all recordings were pooled, the walruses used their right front flipper for waving above the sediment during 66% of the bottom time and the left front flipper in only 4%. Rooting with the muzzle constituted 29%, and water jetting about 1% of the bottom time (Table 3, figure 3). When looking at the number of behavioural sequences, the walruses used the right flipper in 48%, the left flipper in 6%, the snout in 43% and water-jetting in 3% of the sequences (Table 3, figure 3). There was a significant difference among time used on the four feeding behaviours (Time: &#x003c7;2r = 36.2; DF = 11; P &#x0003c; 0.0001; Sequences: &#x003c7;2r = 29.4; DF = 11; P = 0.002). Recordings were made from different angles (0, 45, 90, 180, -90, -45 and above). However, there was no association between the location of the camera man and the walrus's chosen foraging behaviour (&#x003c7;2 = 16.78; DF = 18; P = 0.54). When considering only flipper use, the walruses used their right flipper 89% of the time. Six out of the 12 recordings showed that the walrus had a preference for right flipper use, 4 showed no preference and 2 did not use their flippers in the video sequence (Table 2; Binomial two-tailed test). No walrus showed a preference for left flipper use. To obtain enough observations for the Binomial test to reveal any differences, more than 5 counts are necessary (1/2n) [32]. The 4 walrus recordings which showed no preference of flipper usage did not fulfil this requirement. Skeletal asymmetryNo difference of variance of measures of skeletal dimensions was found between subspecies (O. r. divergens and O. r. rosmarus, respectively), age and sex so data were pooled (Subspecies difference, F-test values: Scapula 2.84; DF = 6,8; Humerus 5.05; DF = 8,2; Ulna 1.87; DF = 8,5; P &#x0003e; 0.05. Juvenile vs. Adult, F-test values: Scapula 2.22; DF = 3,11; Humerus 3.26; DF = 8,2; Ulna 2.29; DF = 4,9; P &#x0003e; 0.05. Female vs. Male, F-test values: Scapula 2.51; DF = 4,8; Humerus 1.02; DF = 8,1; Ulna 1.29; DF = 6,4; P &#x0003e; 0.05). On average, the right flipper was larger than the left flipper for all bone measurements except scapula height, where differences were negligible. These differences were statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test) for the scapula (z = 2.83; P = 0.005), humerus (z = 2.86; P = 0.004) and ulna (z = 2.37; P = 0.018) (Table 4). The differences in mass of right- and left-hand bones were not significant (Table 4). The average difference of asymmetries was larger for adult specimens for 5 out of the 9 measurements (Tables 5 and 6). Top Abstract Background Results sidebar menu small square Discussion Conclusions Methods Authors' contributions Supplementary Material References Discussion Walrus foraging behaviourThe underwater recordings from Young Sound showed that the walruses as one of three techniques used flipper waving as a method for clearing away sediment. The observations from the present study showed that by moving a front flipper the walrus seemed to keep an area in front of its head clear from stirred up sediment. This corresponds with previous observations [19,33] where captive Pacific walruses kept their eyes open and seemed to be using their eyesight during feeding. Anatomy studies are also supporting this behaviour [33]. One may envisage that since foraging cause turbidity of suspended material, a walrus would have an advantage in positioning itself accordingly, that is, letting the current move the sediment away and behind the animal, all the time feeding and moving in a forward leading direction. The walruses in the captivity study exhibited muzzle use and water jetting for excavation of bivalves while resting on their fore flippers. A possible reason for the differences in behaviour reported by Kastelein et al. [19,33] and ours could be the depth of buried prey. The bivalves in the pool were buried at a depth of 10 cm [8] whereas walruses in the wild need to excavate prey that is buried down to a depth of 40 cm [6,14]. The dominating sediment type in Young Sound shallow waters (&#x0003c;20 m) is sand [34], which could reinforce flipper use as a way of sediment removal in combination with currents. The captive walruses were normally hand-fed different kinds of fish [18], which might also explain their lack of flipper waving. Another difference between the pool-based trial [8] and our study is the need for wild-living walruses to adjust for the water current which is sometimes strong in Young Sound, however the recordings indicated that the walruses mainly used the flipper motion for removal of sediment (Video Clip 1,3). At present our data cannot exclude the possibility that animals from other geographical regions will show other foraging behaviours than those described in the present study perhaps depending on prey density, distribution of prey or sediment type. Such spatial difference in behaviour across populations and individuals was documented in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) [35] and in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) [36]. Because all 12 walrus recordings were collected in connection with a study design that required a defined feeding spot [14], our results are based on observations of walruses feeding in a localised area described as a pit [6,7]. Studies [6,7] described furrows left in the sediment from foraging walruses. Such structures were also observed in Young Sound. In species, which exhibit behaviour where a forelimb is involved, a preference for one side might evolve first by chance and then reinforced [37,38] without this being induced by large anatomical asymmetry as seen for e.g. the fiddler crab (Uca sp.) [39]. If walruses always use only one flipper at a time it might gradually cause adaptation of a favourite side used for waving. Indeed, such lateralization has been reported in the fin preference of catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) [38]. We found that 89% of the time spent flipper waving on the sea floor was with the right flipper. Clapham et al. [40] documented lateralized behaviour when examining four different behaviours in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) one of which was flippering (the whale would raise one flipper and slap on the surface of the water). At the individual level there was a 77% preference for use of the right forelimb for flippering. Lateralized behaviour (90% right handedness) at the population level is best described for humans [23,41]. There are different views regarding the origin of handedness in humans and whether this phenomenon is related to the evolution of hemispheric asymmetry/specialization or of language, or whether it has some unrelated genetic basis [21-24]. Evolutionary laterality is still debated because of the implications of brain evolution in hominids and non-human species [42]. At present the knowledge we have of walrus brain morphology and genetics does not justify a theoretical discussion as seen for hominoids. However, here we will discuss it as a the morphometric adaptation of bone tissue to lateralized forelimb preference and function [28]. A preference for one particular side at the individual level is likely to be reinforced by use [37,38], but if the asymmetric bias occurs randomly, then handedness would approach 50:50 at the population level. Clearly, our behavioural data do not indicate a 50:50 distribution. Lateralized limb use may be encouraged by the limbs being partially or totally freed from support of the body, which is the case of walruses in the water. The implications of these findings suggest that tool-use and object manipulation is not mandatory for development of strong limb preferences approaching handedness. Skeletal asymmetrySignificant asymmetries of the flipper skeletons of walruses were detected in 3 of 5 length measurements. The greatest asymmetries were found in scapula length. Many of the muscles that control the forelimb attach to this bone [43], which means that a longer right scapula could indicate a greater muscle mass associated with the right flipper [27]. Although the mass measurement of scapula did not show any difference, we suggest that the asymmetry might be based on achieving more power compared to a longer reach. Given that walruses spend most of their time at sea where gravity will have less of an impact compared to a land mammal we might not expect to see a higher bone density or mass difference. Skeletal asymmetries of the limbs have only been documented in very few other species. A study on a small sample of eleven chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), failed to reveal clear skeletal asymmetries [44]. Falk et al. [45] found significantly larger right-side values for seven out of ten assessed dimensions in 150 rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). A recent study of 441 harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) revealed that the right scapula, humerus, radius and ulna were significantly longer than the left (A. Galatius unpublished data). Latimer &#x00026; Lowrance [25] found length differences of about 1% between right and left humerus, radius and ulna in a human population (our calculation on the basis of their data). The relative asymmetries are thus somewhat larger in humans compared to walruses, where the average asymmetries in these bones were 0.29% (radius), 0.64% (humerus) and 0.62% (ulna) (Table 4). Again being a land mammal gravity could account for an effect. If, as our results suggest, the asymmetries are larger in adult specimens, these values may be substantially larger in a sample of adults, since the present sample had only 6 adult specimens out of 23 (Table 5 and 6). It has not been possible to find any other studies on asymmetry of the limbs of pinnipeds, but more research on walruses, in particular, is warranted in order to elucidate possible differences between juveniles and adults, males and females and subspecies. Top Abstract Background Results Discussion sidebar menu small square Conclusions Methods Authors' contributions Supplementary Material References Conclusions The Atlantic walruses studied tended to exhibit one or more feeding behaviours while staying at the bottom. In contrast to previously knowledge, flipper use seemed to be of high importance combined with muzzle use. A preference for use of the right flipper rather than the left was indicated. The observations of foraging behaviour in the wild in combination with measurements of limb skeletal asymmetry, suggest that lateralized limb use occurs in the walrus. Although based on small sample sizes this is to our knowledge the first record of a pinniped showing lateralized behaviour. More data on an individual level for several continuous years is warranted from walruses in the water as well as on haul-out. The controlled feeding experiments by Marshall et al. [46] using a plexiglass feeding platform could be an excellent approach for studying the use of whiskers and handling of bivalves. Top Abstract Background Results Discussion Conclusions sidebar menu small square Methods Authors' contributions Supplementary Material References Methods Walrus foraging behaviourFieldwork took place between 26 July and 15 August 2001 (i.e. during the open-water season) in Young Sound, (74&#x000b0;18 N; 20&#x000b0;15 V), a high-Arctic fjord in Northeast Greenland (Figure 4). When a foraging walrus was observed, the divers approached the animal in a rubber dinghy with an outboard 40 Hp Johnson motor. For safety reasons, scuba diving was only possible with animals foraging at water depths of less than about 30 m. The same protocol was used for every diving event with a feeding walrus. To allow the animal to get accustomed to the presence of the dinghy and the people in it, the diver did not enter the water until the walrus had completed 5&#x02013;6 feeding cycles. On average, a feeding cycle consisted of a 6.7 minute dive and 1.0 minute at the surface [14]. The waiting time was used for identification and recording the diving and surfacing times and for observing any change in the feeding behaviour of the study animal. The walrus, which on first approach kept a distance of about 20&#x02013;50 m to the dinghy, soon appeared not to pay the boat and the diver any notice. At that moment a diver went into the water, and when the animal showed signs of beginning on a foraging dive, he followed the walrus down to the sea bottom (Figure 5). When reaching the sea floor the diver placed himself 0.5&#x02013;2 m from the foraging walrus where he recorded the whole feeding session without disturbing the animal (Figure 5). After a feeding session the divers collected recently emptied bivalve shells for quantification of food intake as described by Born et al. [14]. The data used in the present analysis were collected during 8 days in the field period. Recordings were made for a total of 2.5 hours using a Sony VX1000 video camera and mini-digital videotapes. These tapes were subsequently run through a software program (Speed Razor Mach 4.7s in-sync) while played on a Sony Digital Component 16 Bit + 12 Bit Stereo/TBC/Timecode show-view DHR-1000 VC Digital Video Casette Recorder for further analysis. Still photos were taken of the foraging walruses and feeding patches using a NikonF100 camera in a waterproof case. The digital videotapes had date and time codes for all recordings. These were used together with natural breaks in the behaviour to differentiate between individuals. The ID-numbers of walrus recordings #1&#x02013;12 were given to animals based on the time and date of the recording. Only recordings with animals showing one of the four feeding behaviours were given an ID-number (Table 2). Animals observed at different times of day or on different dates were given new numbers even though they may have been recordings of the same animal from different days. The recordings did not give enough information to differentiate among animals based on individual marks or tusk shapes. However, based on the notes of the photographer, at least 5 different individuals were involved. For the analyses of the recordings the methods of "focal sampling" and "continuous observations" were used [47]. The feeding behaviours seen on the video-recordings were categorised in the following way: (1) "Waving of the right-hand flipper", (2) "waving of the left flipper", (3) "Rooting with muzzle", and (4) "Using a water-jet". Flipper use was calculated as counts of strokes and total time of the entire sequence using the same flipper. Snout movement and water jetting was counted as one sequence and was timed from beginning to end. To test for differences in choice of behaviour, the use of a flipper was counted as one sequence regardless of the number of strokes in that sequence. In this way, comparison between all four behaviours was possible. A &#x003c7;2-test [32] was used to explore whether there was a difference between the proportion of sequence counts of flipper use and muzzle use between different recordings. Behavioural category "right flipper wave" was pooled with "left flipper wave" and "water-jetting" with "muzzle use" to meet the conditions for this test. A Friedmann's test [32] was used to test for consistent differences in the time spent on each behaviour across recordings. To test whether the right and left flippers were used in a ratio different from 50:50, a Binomial test (two-tailed) [32] was carried out for each recording (Table 2). Since recordings were made from both sides, in front, behind and above the walruses, the potential influence on the walrus' behaviour of the position of the diver was tested with a &#x003c7;2-test. The test was done on the numbers of the different recording angels for each of the four behaviours. The critical value P &#x0003c; 0.05 was used in all tests. Skeletal asymmetry23 walrus skeletons from the collections of the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen were investigated for asymmetries in the bones of the extremities. The sample consisted of 6 adult and 17 juvenile specimens of both sexes, originating from Greenland (O. r. rosmarus) and the Bering Strait region (O. r. divergens) (see Table 6 for details on specimens studied). The semi-quantitative assessment of whether a skeleton was that of an adult or a juvenile was taken from the written data protocol made by the Zoological Museums curators with one consideration being closed or open epiphyses. The following measurements were made (where possible) to the nearest mm on right and left bones (Figure 6) from each specimen using callipers: (1) The length of the scapula (2) The height of the scapula (3) The length of the humerus (4) The length of the radius (5) The length of the ulna Percentage differences of right/left bone length were calculated as: (Right bone measurement - Left bone measurement) / Left bone measurement * 100. All measurements were made by the same observer. To test for variance differences between subspecies, age and sex an F-test [32] was used. Since the data were not normally distributed, a Wilcoxon non-parametric signed rank test [32] was used to test for differences in bone length and mass. The critical value P &#x0003c; 0.05 was used. If epiphyses were attached to both right and left bones, these were included in the measurements. Lengths were not measured if any damage to the bone that might influence the length, was evident The right and left scapula, humerus, radius and ulna were also weighed to the nearest gram on a digital balance. Masses were not measured if an epiphysis was only attached to one bone of a pair, or if any damage to the bone that might influence the mass was evident.

Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES Abstract The mechanism and machinery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication are still poorly understood. In this study, we labeled de novo-synthesized viral RNA in situ with bromouridine triphosphate (BrUTP) in Huh7 cells expressing an HCV subgenomic replicon. By immunofluorescence staining using an anti-BrUTP antibody and confocal microscopy, we showed that the newly synthesized HCV RNA was localized to distinct speckle-like structures, which also contain all of the HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins. These speckles are distinct from lipid droplets and are separated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where some HCV NS proteins also reside. Membrane flotation analysis demonstrated that almost all of the NS5A and part of the NS5B proteins and all of the viral RNA were present in membrane fractions which are resistant to treatment with 1% NP-40 at 4°C. They were cofractionated with caveolin-2, a lipid-raft-associated intracellular membrane protein, in the presence or absence of the detergent. In contrast, the ER-resident proteins were detergent soluble. These properties suggest that the membranes on which HCV RNA replication occurs are lipid rafts recruited from the intracellular membranes. The protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin did not inhibit viral RNA synthesis, indicating that HCV RNA replication does not require continuous protein synthesis. We suggest that HCV RNA synthesis occurs on a lipid raft membrane structure. Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important human pathogen associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis and is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. As a member of the Flaviviridae family, HCV contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 9.6 kb. The viral genome encodes a single polyprotein of about 3,010 amino acids, which is proteolytically processed by a combination of host- and virus-encoded proteases into 10 viral structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins arranged in the following order: (NH3)-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-(COOH) (18, 28). The establishment of the HCV subgenomic replicon and the subsequent analysis of the adaptive mutations revealed that most of the HCV NS proteins, with the probable exception of NS2, are involved in HCV RNA replication (6, 29, 37). NS3 is a helicase and a serine protease, whose function is dependent on NS4A. It is conceivable that the enzymatic activities of these proteins are key components of the HCV replication complex. The function of NS4B is thus far unknown, although it has been implicated in inducing transformation (34) and intracellular membrane alterations (13); the latter may play a significant role in the formation of the HCV RNA replication complex. NS5A is known to be a multifunctional protein implicated in the pathogenesis and interferon resistance of HCV infection. However, it has become evident that NS5A also plays an indispensable role in the replication of the HCV subgenomic replicon (6), but the underlying mechanism has yet to be identified. HCV NS5B is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). All of these NS proteins, together with host proteins, are believed to form a membrane-associated RNA replication complex. RNA replication of virtually all positive-strand RNA viruses involves certain intracellular membrane structures, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (11, 40, 42, 54, 56), Golgi apparatus (47), endosomes, and lysosomes (14, 53). Most of these viruses induce distinct membrane structures derived from several membrane compartments to provide a structural scaffold for viral RNA replication (4, 5, 12, 17, 35, 54, 58). Previous studies have revealed an association of the HCV NS4B (23), NS5A (7, 39, 46, 52), and NS5B proteins (44) with the ER and/or the Golgi apparatus when they are expressed either alone or in the context of the entire HCV polyprotein. NS3 and NS5B also have been shown by biochemical studies to sediment with membrane fractions isolated from transfected cells (22, 24). In addition, NS5A has been shown by both cytological and biochemical approaches to be present on the surfaces of lipid droplets (46). NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B have all been found to be integral membrane proteins; the membrane association domains of NS5A and NS5B have also been defined (7, 44). A recent study further revealed that NS4B was able to induce a membranous web, with which all HCV proteins were found to be associated, forming a membrane-associated multiprotein complex (13). In HCV subgenomic replicon cells, all NS proteins, including NS3 and NS4A, were shown to be associated with the ER membranes by both fractionation experiments and immunomicroscopy (31). NS3 and NS4A are preferentially localized in the ER cisternae surrounding mitochondria, suggesting additional subcellular compartment-related functions for these viral proteins. Both studies (13, 31) revealed substantial alterations of the ER structure, resembling those observed in liver biopsy specimens of HCV-infected chimpanzees (36). All of the evidence so far is consistent with the formation of a membrane-associated HCV RNA replication complex, which contains most of the HCV NS proteins. However, the considerable variation in the localization of the HCV proteins and the properties of the membrane among these reports left open the question of the nature of the truly functional HCV replication complex. So far, there is no evidence that these membrane structures are associated with active HCV RNA replication. Therefore, we set out to localize and characterize the HCV RNA replication machinery. In this study, we performed bromouridine triphosphate (BrUTP) labeling of de novo-synthesized HCV RNA in HCV subgenomic replicon cells. We found that the replicating HCV RNA and the NS proteins colocalize on a cytoplasmic membrane structure, which is distinct from the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Membrane flotation analysis further demonstrated that these membrane structures were resistant to detergent treatment and cofractionated with a lipid raft-associated protein, caveolin-2, suggesting that they are lipid rafts derived from intracellular membranes. These results suggest that the HCV replication complex may be recruited from the ER or Golgi apparatus to form a lipid raft-associated membrane complex. Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES MATERIALS AND METHODS Establishment of HCV RNA replicon cells. Three different HCV subgenomic replicon constructs were used in this study. The original subgenomic replicon, I377/NS3-3′ (29), containing an adaptive mutation, S1179I (6), was constructed by ligating the synthetic oligonucleotides according to the procedures of Blight et al. (6). Plasmids HCV1bneo and HCV1bneo/delS, which were the subgenomic replicons derived from the HCV-N strain (19, 25), were the kind gifts of C. Seeger (Fox Chase Cancer Center). In vitro-transcribed RNA was generated as previously described (19). Subconfluent Huh7 cells were trypsinized and washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids and once with serum-free DMEM. Cell pellets were resuspended in serum-free DMEM at a density of 107 cells/ml. Forty micrograms of in vitro-transcribed RNA was added to 400 μl of the cell suspension in an electroporation cuvette (0.4-cm gap; Molecular Bioproducts, San Diego, Calif.). Cells were electroporated with a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif. ) set to 220 V and 975 μF. Subsequently, the cell suspension was diluted into DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide and seeded onto a 10-cm cell culture plate. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with the same medium containing G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif. ) without dimethyl sulfoxide at 500 μg/ml (active dose), and the medium was changed twice per week. G418-resistant colonies were isolated after 2 to 3 weeks. Antibodies. The monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) antibody, which cross-reacts with bromouridine (BrU), was purchased from Roche Diagnostics Corporation (Indianapolis, Ind.). The mouse monoclonal antibody against NS3 was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, Calif.). The mouse monoclonal antibody against NS5A was purchased from Biodesign (Saco, Maine). The mouse monoclonal antibody against NS5B was made by using NS5B expressed from a recombinant baculovirus (24). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against calreticulin was obtained from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, Colo,). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 were acquired from New England Biolabs (Beverly, Mass.). M2 beads used for immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged proteins were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against NS5A has been described previously (52). Cell permeabilization and labeling of de novo-synthesized viral RNA. Cell permeabilization with lysolecithin and detection of viral RNA synthesis were performed as described previously (47). Huh7 cells were plated on 8-well chamber slides at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well. One day after seeding, cells were incubated with actinomycin D (5 μg/μl) for 1 h and washed twice with serum-free medium. Subsequently, 100 μg of lysolecithin/ml was added to the permeabilization buffer (47), and cells were incubated for 90 s on ice. The permeabilized cells were then incubated in a transcription buffer (47) containing 0.5 mM BrUTP for 30 min. After incubation, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence staining as described below. Protein synthesis inhibitors. The protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide (CHX) and puromycin were purchased from Sigma. Huh7 replicon cells were incubated with CHX (10 μg/ml) or puromycin (50 μg/ml) for 3 h prior to permeabilization and BrUTP labeling of the cells as described above. These inhibitors were shown to inhibit [35S]methionine incorporation of Huh7 cells at the concentrations used. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. Huh7 cells were plated on 8-well chamber slides at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well. One day after seeding, slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, followed by 15 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with cells for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) were added to cells at a 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After staining, slides were washed in PBS and mounted in ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). For semiquantitative analysis, at least 10 separate fields were examined for each staining. The criterion for determination of cells with a particular staining pattern was set as more than 80% of the cells in every field showing that pattern. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope LSM 510. The pinhole used for all experiments was 0.8 μm. Image analysis was performed using the standard system operating software provided with the microscope. Colocalization of green (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and red (tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate) signals in a single pixel produces yellow, while separated signals remain green or red. Membrane flotation assay. The membrane flotation assay was performed as previously described (41). Cells were first lysed in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2) and passed through a 25-gauge needle 20 times. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. Cell lysates were then mixed with 3 ml of 72% sucrose in low-salt buffer (LSB, comprising 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 25 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2) and overlaid with 4 ml of 55% sucrose in LSB, followed by 1.5 ml of 10% sucrose in LSB. In some experiments, as indicated, cell lysates were treated with 1% NP-40, 1 M NaCl, or 0.1 M NaCO3 (pH 11.5) on ice for 20 min before being loaded onto a sucrose gradient. The sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor for 14 h at 4°C. One-milliliter fractions were taken from the top of the gradient, and each was concentrated by being passed through a Centricon YM-10 or YM-100 filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). The pellet was resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and analyzed on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Detection of HCV RNA by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). HCV RNA was extracted from 50 μl of each sucrose gradient fraction with the TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc. , Cincinnati, Ohio), according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using antisense primer #36 (32). The first-round PCR was performed with antisense primer #36 and sense primer #32 for 30 cycles. The second-round PCR was performed with nested primer pairs of #33 and #48 (32) for another 25 cycles. Amplified cDNA fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES RESULTS HCV NS proteins are localized on both the ER and other membrane structures in replicon cells. To identify the nature and subcellular localization of HCV RNA replication, we first reexamined the localization of the NS proteins, which are likely involved in viral RNA replication, in Huh7 cells supporting a subgenomic RNA replicon. Three stable Huh7 cell lines containing different HCV-1b subgenomic replicon RNAs (see Materials and Methods) were used. Localization of NS proteins was determined by immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies against NS3, NS5A, and NS5B. Most of the NS3 and NS5A proteins showed diffuse perinuclear staining, which partially colocalized with calreticulin (51) (Fig. 1), indicating that these proteins were localized partly in the ER. This distribution is similar to what was observed when these proteins were expressed in isolation or as the full-length HCV polyprotein (39, 46, 59). However, in many of the replicon cells, besides the ER localization, these proteins were also detected on discrete speckles or patches in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, right panels). These speckles did not colocalize with calreticulin. A similar pattern was also observed for NS5B (data not shown). In some cells, most of the NS proteins were present as prominent speckles, with fainter staining on the ER or the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with three different replicon cells. The HCV1bneo/delS replicon was used in most of the subsequent experiments, since it appeared to yield the highest number of cells containing the speckle-like staining patterns. The relative distribution of NS proteins in the speckles and in the ER-Golgi apparatus varied from cell to cell. These speckles contained most of the NS proteins, as evidenced by the colocalization of NS3, NS5A, and NS5B on these structures (Fig. 2). It should be noted that NS3 had a wider distribution than NS5A, as some of the NS3 did not overlap with NS5A (Fig. 2). This finding is consistent with the potential role of NS3 in HCV protein processing, in addition to its possible role in RNA replication. However, the possibility that the NS3-specific antibody is more sensitive than the anti-NS5A antibody cannot be ruled out. Some of the speckle-like structures resembled oil droplets, which have previously been shown to colocalize with HCV NS5A (46); in particular, some NS proteins appeared to be localized at the circumferences of the spherical particles (Fig. 1; see also Fig. 5 below). To determine whether these structures were lipid droplets, we performed Oil Red O staining of lipid droplets (46) in the replicon cells (Fig. 3). Clearly, the majority of NS5A did not colocalize with lipid droplets, in contrast to what was previously observed in cells expressing NS5A alone (46). Therefore, these speckle-like structures are not lipid droplets. None of the NS3, NS5A, or NS5B antibodies stained normal Huh7 cells or Huh7 cells expressing the neo gene and growing in the presence of G418 (data not shown). Colocalization of de novo-synthesized HCV RNA and NS proteins in speckles. To test the possibility that these speckles may be associated with viral RNA synthesis, we adopted a system for labeling de novo-synthesized HCV RNA in lysolecithin-permeabilized cells (47). The HCV RNA was labeled by BrUTP incorporation in the presence of actinomycin D, followed by detection of brominated nucleotides with a monoclonal antibody. Under such conditions, fluorescent staining in distinct speckles of various sizes was found in the cytoplasm of Huh7 cells supporting an HCV replicon, whereas no signal was detected in Huh7 cells without a replicon (Fig. 4). These speckles most likely represent virus-specific RNA. Remarkably, this cytoplasmic staining appears very similar to the prominent speckles of the NS proteins (Fig. 1 and 2). Since BrUTP labeling was carried out for 15 to 30 min, the majority of the labeling observed most likely represents newly synthesized viral RNA, which is likely in the viral RNA replication machinery. We used three different replicon RNA constructs; similar patterns were observed (data not shown). To establish that the NS proteins are associated with the replicon RNA, we performed dual labeling experiments using a polyclonal antibody against NS5A and a monoclonal antibody against the brominated RNA. The staining patterns of the NS proteins were similar in lysolecithin-permeabilized and untreated cells (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 5), indicating that the lysolecithin treatment did not disrupt the normal cell morphology. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that the BrUTP-labeled RNA colocalized almost precisely with NS5A protein in the speckle-like structures. Since NS5A colocalized with NS5B, NS3 (Fig. 2), and other NS proteins, this result indicates that BrUTP-labeled speckles represent the RNA replication complex and that most of the HCV NS proteins are associated with the viral RNA replication machinery. To examine the metabolic requirement of HCV RNA replication, we treated the cells with CHX for 3 h before permeabilization and BrUTP labeling; HCV RNA replication was not significantly affected (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained for puromycin (data not shown). These results suggest that continuous protein synthesis is not necessary for HCV RNA replication. This is similar to findings for another flavivirus, Kunjin virus, which can carry out RNA replication in the absence of continued protein synthesis (57). The expression and localization patterns of the NS5A protein were not noticeably altered by the treatment, in agreement with the previous finding that HCV NS proteins are very stable (37). Association of HCV NS proteins with detergent-resistant membrane fractions. To determine the properties of the structures that harbor the NS proteins and support HCV RNA synthesis, we performed membrane flotation analysis to separate membrane and cytosolic fractions (41, 46). The membrane-containing materials float to the top of the sucrose gradient, while the cytosolic fractions remain at the bottom. The presence of the NS proteins in each fraction was determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 7A, both NS5A and NS5B were found predominantly in the membrane fractions (fractions 2 and 3). Previously (46), an ER marker, GRP 78, was found to be distributed in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions. A similar distribution was observed for another ER marker, calreticulin (data not shown). The detection of some ER markers as cytosolic proteins by use of these procedures is common (33). When the cell lysates were treated on ice with 1% NP-40, a nonionic detergent—a condition which released all of the ER proteins to the cytosol (46)—only a small percentage of the NS5A protein was dissociated from the membrane and moved to the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 7B). This result indicates that NS5A is associated with a very special kind of membrane that is detergent insoluble. This type of membrane is referred to as a lipid raft (20, 48). However, more than half of the NS5B was detected in the cytosolic fractions after detergent treatment, indicating that not all of the NS proteins are in the detergent-insoluble complexes. Alternatively, NS5B may not be associated with the membrane as tightly as NS5A. Nevertheless, a substantial portion of NS5B was also in the membrane that is resistant to the detergent treatment. To characterize the nature of these detergent-resistant membrane fractions, we examined several cellular proteins known to be associated with different lipid-containing membranes in the cells. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), which is largely localized in plasma membrane caveolae and the Golgi apparatus (33), was detected mainly in the soluble fractions both before and after NP-40 treatment (Fig. 7A and B). However, Cav-2, which is present on cytoplasmic lipid rafts as well as lipid droplets (15, 33, 38, 50), was mostly present in the detergent-resistant membrane fractions, similar to the distribution of NS5A and NS5B. It has been reported that only Cav-2, not Cav-1, was detected in the membrane fractions upon detergent treatment (15). Although Cav-1 and Cav-2 can interact with each other (43), it is possible that Cav-2 may be present in additional membrane structures resistant to nonionic detergents or that it may have a stronger association with the membranes than Cav-1. These results indicate that the NS proteins are associated with detergent-resistant membrane structures that cofractionate with Cav-2. The properties of these membrane structures resemble those of lipid rafts or lipid droplets. Since the NS protein did not colocalize with the vesicles stained with Oil Red O (Fig. 3), these membrane structures are most likely lipid rafts. Finally, the distribution of these proteins was not affected by treatment with 1 M NaCl or 0.1 M NaCO3 (Fig. 7C and D, respectively), indicating that they were integral membrane proteins, consistent with earlier findings for cells stably expressing HCV NS proteins in the absence of RNA replication (7, 44). Association of HCV replicon RNA with detergent-resistant membrane fractions. We further examined the distribution of HCV RNA after membrane flotation analysis of HCV replicon cells. HCV RNA was detected by RT-PCR analysis. All of the HCV RNA was detected in the membrane fractions (fractions 1 to 4) (Fig. 8). The distribution of HCV RNA appeared to be slightly wider than that of the NS proteins. This difference could be due to the higher sensitivity of RT-PCR than of Western blotting. Significantly, none of the RNAs were solubilized by treatment with 1% NP-40. Although the amount of HCV RNA appeared to have decreased slightly after detergent treatment, no RNA was detected in the cytosolic fractions. These results combined suggest that both HCV RNA and NS proteins were present in the same membrane fractions and have similar detergent-resistant properties. They most likely reside in the same structures. Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES DISCUSSION In the present study, we have characterized the localization of the HCV NS proteins and newly synthesized viral RNA in Huh7 cells that support active RNA replication of a subgenomic HCV replicon. We showed that most of the HCV NS proteins and RNA colocalized with each other on distinct speckle-like structures in the cytoplasm of the replicon cells, which may represent the sites of HCV RNA replication. This speckle-like appearance of the NS proteins is in contrast to their perinuclear ER and Golgi localization typically seen in cells that express only HCV NS proteins in the absence of RNA replication (26, 39, 45, 46, 52). These results suggest that, in subgenomic replicon cells, the HCV NS proteins may be recruited from a wider distribution in the cytoplasm, such as the ER and Golgi apparatus, to the more localized sites where active RNA replication occurs. Biochemical analysis further showed that the HCV NS proteins and RNA were present on detergent-insoluble membrane structures characteristic of lipid rafts or lipid droplets. Since there was no colocalization between the NS proteins and lipid droplets (Fig. 3) in the replicon cells, it is most likely that HCV RNA synthesis occurs on a lipid raft structure. The use of BrUTP labeling has enabled us to characterize HCV RNA replication in situ for the first time. We clearly showed colocalization of the NS proteins with HCV RNA, strongly suggesting the involvement of the NS proteins in viral RNA synthesis. We found a strong correlation between the level of viral RNA replication and the number of cells, among the different HCV replicon cell clones, that exhibited the speckle-like distribution of NS proteins. The speckle-like structures were not seen in cells without HCV RNA synthesis. These results collectively support the notion that HCV RNA replication occurs on the speckle-like structures. Continuous protein synthesis is required for RNA synthesis of some RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses (47). However, we found that HCV RNA synthesis was completely resistant to CHX or puromycin treatment for at least 3 h before BrUTP labeling, indicating that HCV RNA replication does not rely on continuous protein synthesis. HCV proteins have been shown to be relatively stable; even the most unstable protein (NS5A) was found to have a half-life of 7 h (37). These proteins are thus capable of multiple rounds of RNA synthesis in situ. Resistance of viral RNA synthesis to inhibitors of protein synthesis has also been demonstrated for another flavivirus, Kunjin virus (57). The results of our present study appear to be at odds with a reported study showing that the NS proteins were associated with the ER in another replicon system (37). The difference between the localization patterns of NS proteins in these two reports may be attributed to the high level of HCV RNA replication in our replicon cells. We found that the more active the viral RNA synthesis was, the more cells exhibited such a speckle-like appearance of the NS proteins. Our finding that the de novo-synthesized HCV RNA was also localized to the speckles supports the notion that the HCV NS proteins are involved in HCV RNA synthesis and that the speckles represent the intracellular sites in which viral RNA is actively replicating in the replicon cells. The NS proteins that are localized on the ER may represent the proteins involved in the process of translation or transport but may not reflect the status of active viral RNA replication. The nature of the speckles where HCV RNA and the NS proteins reside is unknown. All of the HCV structural and NS proteins were reportedly associated with the membranous webs (13). The nature of the speckles was suggested by the biochemical characterization, which revealed that they are highly resistant to detergent and high salt concentrations, properties characteristic of lipid rafts or lipid droplets. Lipid rafts are localized mainly at the level of plasma membrane but also can form within internal membrane compartments, such as the Golgi apparatus (16). The lipid droplets serve as energy storage sites (8, 55). They consist of a core of triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters, which is synthesized in the ER, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer, which is also derived from the ER (8, 55). Lipid rafts differ from lipid droplets in their membrane compositions and contents, but both of them are rich in Cav-2 (15, 33, 38, 50). Our studies have shown that the HCV RNA replication complex was not localized to lipid droplets; thus, it is most likely associated with lipid rafts. Preliminary findings from our laboratory further showed that the membrane-associated HCV NS proteins and Cav-2 could be rendered soluble by treatment with β-octylglucoside, a nonionic detergent known to disrupt the association of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins with lipid rafts (9) (data not shown), providing further evidence that the HCV NS proteins are indeed associated with lipid rafts. Furthermore, since the HCV RNA replication complex cofractionates with Cav-2 but not with Cav-1, the lipid raft where HCV RNA replicates is most likely derived from the internal cellular membranes. Several other viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (10), murine leukemia virus (27), measles virus (30), Ebola virus, Marburg virus (3), influenza virus (2), and Epstein-Barr virus (21), have been reported to require lipid rafts in their life cycles. Although the internal lipid rafts are not well characterized, they have been implicated in various cellular functions, including vesicular trafficking and signal transduction (1, 50). HCV may induce the formation of these important intracellular structures to serve as the sites of viral RNA replication. Localization of the NS proteins on lipid rafts also may alter certain signal transduction pathways, as lipid rafts are strongly linked to signal transduction (49). Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that the HCV NS proteins are associated with viral RNA replication machinery, which is localized on distinct speckle-like cytoplasmic membrane structures. These structures were detergent insoluble and cofractionated with Cav-2, suggesting that they may possess characteristics similar to those of lipid rafts. These findings will facilitate further characterization of the components of the HCV RNA replication complex.

Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES Abstract A post-proline endopeptidase (PepO2) was detected in cell extracts from a genomic library of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ32 by using the synthetic substrate N-acetyl-β-casein-(f203-209)-ρ-nitroanilide in a coupled reaction with aminopeptidase N. Isolates with activity for this substrate contained plasmids with visually indistinguishable restriction profiles. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,947-bp open reading frame, designated pepO2, encoding a putative 71.4-kDa protein. Analysis of the predicted peptide sequence revealed that L. helveticus PepO2 contained the zinc-dependent metalloprotease motif HEXXH and exhibited levels of amino acid sequence similarity of 72, 61, 59, and 53% to L. helveticus PepO, Lactococcus lactis PepO2, L. lactis PepO, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus PepO, respectively. Northern hybridization results indicated that the transcript containing pepO2 was monocistronic. Despite the high degrees of amino acid similarity to PepO proteins from other lactic acid bacteria, the specificity of the L. helveticus PepO2 for post-proline bonds distinguishes it from other PepO-type endopeptidases characterized to date. The specificity for post-proline bonds also suggests that this enzyme may play a central role in the hydrolysis of casein-derived bitter peptides, such as β-casein(f193-209).

During growth in milk, LAB rely on their proteolytic systems to obtain essential amino acids from caseins (CNs), the most abundant proteins in milk (9, 17). Additionally, proteolytic enzymes from LAB produce flavor compounds and precursors that are essential for cheese flavor development (9, 23). The proteolytic systems of LAB can be functionally divided into three components: (i) cell envelope-associated proteinases which hydrolyze CNs to oligopeptides; (ii) peptide transport systems, of which the oligopeptide transport system is the most important in milk and cheese; and (iii) numerous intracellular peptidases (9, 17). The intracellular peptidases of LAB include both endopeptidases and aminopeptidases. Endopeptidases, due to their ability to hydrolyze peptide bonds within a peptide, are of particular interest in targeting peptides for rapid hydrolysis. In Lactococcus lactis, the best-characterized LAB, the endopeptidases that have been identified include PepO, PepO2, PepF1, and PepF2. All of these enzymes are metalloproteases, and PepO, PepF1, and PepF2 are encoded in operons (9, 17). The physiological roles of these endopeptidases remain unclear; however, PepF appears to be important for protein turnover during nitrogen starvation (24). To date, one metalloendopeptidase, designated PepO (8), and a thiol-dependent endopeptidase, designated PepE (13), have been characterized from Lactobacillus helveticus. The ability of L. helveticus CNRZ32 to accelerate cheese ripening and reduce bitterness when it is used as an adjunct culture is well documented (2, 3, 21). While numerous enzymes of the proteolytic system of L. helveticus have been identified (9), our understanding of the specific enzymes responsible for this strain's ability to reduce the bitterness in cheese is incomplete. The peptide β-CN(f193-209), which is produced by the activity of chymosin on β-CN, has been implicated in the development of bitterness in cheese (4, 20). The purpose of this study and another study (10) was to identify and characterize an L. helveticus endopeptidase(s) involved in the hydrolysis of β-CN(f193-209). Additionally, the accumulation of αs1-CN(f1-9) has been associated with bitterness (4, 5, 15); therefore, the hydrolysis of this peptide was also examined. Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains, plasmid, and media. L. helveticus CNRZ32 (16) and its derivatives were grown in MRS broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich. ) (12) at 37°C. L. lactis LM0230 was obtained from L. L. McKay (University of Minnesota, St. Paul) and was propagated at 30°C in M17-glucose broth (Difco Laboratories) (30). Escherichia coli DH5α (Gibco-BRL Life Technologies Inc. , Gaithersburg, Md.) and derivatives of this strain were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (27) at 37°C with aeration. Agar plates were prepared by adding 1.5% (wt/vol) granulated agar (Difco Laboratories) to liquid media. Erythromycin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was added to liquid media or agar plates at a concentration of 500 μg/ml to select for pJDC9 (7) in E. coli. Screening of L. helveticus CNRZ32 genomic library. A previously constructed genomic library of L. helveticus CNRZ32 in E. coli DH5α (25) was screened for endopeptidase activity by using an amino-terminal blocked chromogenic substrate, N-acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρ-nitroanilide [N-acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA] (SynPep Co., Dublin, Calif.); this substrate is based on the C-terminal amino acid sequence of Bos taurus β-CN. Pooled cultures (10 isolates/pool) were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth containing erythromycin. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature, washed, and suspended in 10 mM bis(2-hydroxyethyl)imino-Tris (pH 6.5; Sigma). Cell extracts (CFEs) were obtained from E. coli cultures by vortexing samples with glass beads alternating with cooling on ice (1 min each); this procedure was repeated twice, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 min at 13,000 × g. CFEs obtained from mid-log-phase cultures of L. helveticus CNRZ32 and E. coli DH5α(pJDC9) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The presence of endopeptidase activity was determined by adding 100 μl of CFE to 395 μl of 10 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.5) containing 1 mM N-acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA. The appearance of an intense yellow color (resulting from release of ρNA) within 15 min was considered an indication of endopeptidase activity. In the coupled reaction, 20 μl of CFE from E. coli DH5α containing aminopeptidase N activity (pJDC9::pepN) was used. All assays were performed in duplicate. Plasmid isolation and cloning. Plasmid isolation from E. coli was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (27). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Gibco-BRL and were used as recommended by the manufacturer. Electroporation of E. coli was performed by using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif. ) as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. All primers were synthesized by GIBCO-BRL Custom Primers (Grand Island, N.Y.). PCR and DNA sequencing reactions were performed with a Perkin-Elmer model 480 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp. , Norwalk, Conn.). DNA sequencing reactions were performed by using a Prism Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc. , Foster City, Calif.). DNA templates were purified with a Qiagen Inc. (Hilden, Germany) PCR purification kit. Sequencing was initially performed with primers M13 and M13R (GIBCO-BRL). As the known sequenced progressed, new primers were designed accordingly. Additional primers were designed by using the Affinity program supplied by Ransom Hill Bioscience, Inc. (Ramona, Calif.). DNA sequences were determined by the Nucleic Acid and Protein Facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center with an ABI model 370/3 automated sequencer. Sequences were analyzed by using the GCG sequence analysis package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc. , Madison, Wis.). Protein homology searches were performed by using the BLAST network service (1). All reported DNA sequence data were confirmed by sequencing both DNA strands from at least two independent PCR products. mRNA analysis. Transcription of the pepO2 gene was investigated by using an 810-bp internal pepO2 fragment (nucleotides 607 to 1416) that was amplified and the PCR product end labeled with digoxigenin (Genius system; Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for Northern hybridization. The primers used for probe amplification were YC-2290 (5′GATGCGATTGCACTCG) and YC-2000 (5′GATAGCGGCAGGGAAG). Total RNA was isolated by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA molecular weight markers, solutions, and reagents used for Northern hybridization and chemiluminescent detection were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Northern hybridization was performed by using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Mapping of the 5′ end of the pepO2 transcript was accomplished by using a kit for 5′ end rapid amplification of cDNA (5′RACE) (version 2.0; GIBCO-BRL). The gene-specific primers used for 5′RACE were YC-2340 (5′GTTTTCGGTTTGCTTTTG), YC-2600 (5′CGGCATCTCTTTTGGC), and YC-2840 (5′GGACGATCGGCAGGG). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with primer YC-2340. Nested amplification of first-strand cDNA was carried out with primer YC-2600 and the anchor primer supplied with the 5′RACE kit. Sequencing reactions were conducted with primer YC-2840 by using the nested amplification product as the template. Synthesis of peptide substrates. The peptides αS1-CN(f1-9) and β-CN(f193-209) were synthesized at the Utah State University Biotechnology Center. The synthesized peptides were subsequently purified by collection of appropriate fractions after preparatory reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the identities were confirmed by Edman degradation with an Applied Biosystems model 477B protein sequencer. The peptides were lyophilized and stored at −80°C. Stock solutions were prepared in sterile double-distilled water (ddH2O) and also stored at −80°C. Peptide hydrolysis reactions. Peptide hydrolysis reactions were performed essentially as described in the accompanying paper (10). A 10-μl aliquot of CFE (0.95 to 1.05 mg of protein per ml) was diluted in 500 μl (total reaction volume) of 0.1 M Bis-Tris buffer (pH 6.5). The reactions were initiated by adding the substrate, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for a minimum of 30 min. The initial substrate concentration in the reaction samples was 0.2 μg/μl for both β-CN(f193-209) and αs1-CN(f1-9). Reactions were stopped by immediately freezing preparations at −20°C. Peptide separation and identification. Samples were injected into a 20-μl loop by using a Gilson model 231 sample injector equipped with a model 401 dilutor module containing a ddH2O-acetonitrile wash solution (1:1; Gilson Medical Electronics, Paris, France). The peptides were separated by using a Phenomenex Columbus C18 column (250 by 2 mm; 5μ; 100 Å; Phenomenex Columbus, Torrance, Calif. ) preceded by a Brownlee RP-18 precolumn. The mobile phase flow rate and gradient were controlled with a Hitachi L-6200A pump (Hitachi Instruments, San Jose, Calif.). Mobile phases were continuously degassed by slow helium sparging. Peptides were detected with a Hitachi L-4500A diode array detector in the low-absorbance mode. Data was collected by using the Hitachi Chromatography Data Station software with a wavelength range of 200 to 300 nm, a 4-nm spectral bandwidth, and a 3,200-ms spectral interval. Mobile phase A consisted of ddH2O-MeCN (99:1) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of ddH2O-MeCN (20:80) with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Separation and elution of αS1-CN(f1-9) hydrolysis samples were accomplished with the following gradient: 1 to 16% mobile phase B from 0 to 20 min at a rate of 0.25 ml/min, 90% mobile phase B from 20 to 22 min at a rate of 0.25 ml/min, and 90 to 1% mobile phase B from 22 to 25 min at a rate of 0.25 ml/min. Separation and elution of β-CN(f193-209) hydrolysis samples were accomplished with the following gradient: 4 to 60% mobile phase B from 0 to 40 min at a rate of 0.25 ml/min, 60 to 98% mobile phase B from 40 to 41 min at a rate of 0.25 ml/min, 98% mobile phase B from 41 to 45 min at a rate of 0.25 to 0.50 ml/min, and 98 to 4% mobile phase B from 45 to 47 min at a rate of 0.50 to 0.25 ml/min. The pump back pressure was ~1400 lb/in2 at zero time and remained below 1,600 lb/in2 for the duration of the gradients. Samples being separated for fraction collection were monitored in real time. Fractions were collected manually, taking into account a predetermined time for the peptide to travel from the detector flow cell to the capture point. The masses of RP-HPLC-separated peptide fractions were determined by using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass Quattro II) with electrospray ionization sources at the Utah State University Biotechnology Center. To identify the hydrolysis products, the masses were compared to calculated molecular masses of peptides and/or amino acids derived from β-CN(f193-209) and αs1-CN(f1-9). Nucleotide sequence accession number. The nucleotide sequence of pepO2 has been deposited in the GenBank database under accession no. AF321529. Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES RESULTS Screening of the genomic library. Before the L. helveticus genomic library was screened, a number of preliminary tests were conducted. CFEs of L. helveticus CNRZ32 and E. coli DH5α were examined for endopeptidase activities capable of hydrolyzing acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA. CFE of the L. helveticus CNRZ32 wild-type strain resulted in an intense yellow color (A410, >0.30) within 15 min, while E. coli DH5α CFEs resulted in only a very light yellow color (A410, <0.025) after 10 h. To determine if any of the previously identified L. helveticus proteolytic enzymes were required for hydrolysis of β-CN(f203-209), CFEs prepared from several peptidase mutants were examined for the ability to hydrolyze acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA (Table 1). Aminopeptidase N (PepN) was found to be required for the release of ρNA from acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA. However, no hydrolysis of acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA was observed when we used CFEs prepared from E. coli DH5α expressing L. helveticus PepN (strain JLS242) (Christensen, unpublished data). Together, these results indicate that PepN is required, but is not sufficient, to release ρNA from acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA. Therefore, the genomic library screening analysis was performed by using a coupled enzyme reaction with PepN. A genomic library of L. helveticus CNRZ32 in E. coli DH5α was screened for endopeptidase activities with acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA. Of the 1,880 isolates screened, 2 had activity in a coupled reaction with PepN. The restriction endonuclease profiles of these two isolates were visually indistinguishable (data not shown). One plasmid, designated pSUW99, was selected and used for further analysis. Sequencing of the endopeptidase clone. Restriction mapping of pSUW99 revealed a 6.0-kb insert. Two 3.0-kb SstI fragments and two PstI fragments (2.0 and 4.0 kb) were obtained when the insert was digested with restriction endonucleases SstI and PstI, respectively. Subclones containing individual SstI fragments or PstI fragments in pJDC9 were examined for endopeptidase activity with acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA. Activity was detected only in strains containing one of the 3.0-kb SstI fragments, suggesting that the gene was present on this SstI fragment and contained a PstI site. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 3.0-kb SstI fragment encoding endopeptidase activity was determined, and a 1,947-bp open reading frame (ORF) was identified (Fig. 1). This ORF could encode a 649-amino-acid polypeptide with a deduced molecular mass of 71.4 kDa. Protein sequence homology searches with current BLAST databases revealed high levels of similarity between the deduced amino acid sequence and the amino acid sequences of other LAB PepO-type endopeptidases (6, 14, 22, 32; GenBank accession no. AF179267). This protein exhibited 56% identity and 72% similarity to L. helveticus CNRZ32 endopeptidase PepO (8); therefore, the gene was designated pepO2. L. helveticus PepO2 exhibited 42% identity and 59% similarity to L. lactis PepO (22, 32), 41% identity and 61% similarity to L. lactis PepO2, 38% identity and 57% similarity to Streptococcus thermophilus PepO (6), and 36% identity and 53% similarity to Lactobacillus rhamnosus PepO (11). Significant levels of similarity to mammalian metallopeptidases, including endothelin-converting enzyme (45% similarity) and enkephalinase (neutral endopeptidase; 43% similarity), were also observed. The sequence motif His-Glu-Xxx-Xxx-His, which is characteristic of many zinc-dependent metalloproteases, was also identified in PepO2 between residues 497 and 501 (Fig. 1). The start codon of the ORF is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site (AAGGAG; nucleotides −8 to −13) and by putative promoter −10 (TATGAT; nucleotides −32 to −37) and −35 (TTTTCA; nucleotides −56 to −61) sequences (28). An inverted repeat (nucleotides 1967 to 1979 and 2000 to 2012) was observed in the 3′ noncoding region and may function as a rho-independent transcriptional terminator with a ΔG at 25°C of −21 kcal (31). No signal sequence was detected by using a hydrophilicity plot constructed as described by Kyte and Doolittle (19). mRNA analysis. Northern hybridization performed with total RNA from an exponential culture of L. helveticus CNRZ32 resulted in detection of a transcript that was 2.1 kb long (data not shown). This size corresponds to the size of the pepO2 ORF and indicates that pepO2 is monocistronic. The transcriptional start site for the pepO2 promoter was mapped 26 bp upstream of the pepO2 start codon by 5′RACE (data not shown). Substrate specificity of PepO2. To determine if the PepO2 substrate specificity is similar to that of previously described endopeptidases from L. helveticus CNRZ32, the ability of CFE from E. coli DH5α expressing PepO2 to hydrolyze N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-ρNA, N-benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-ρNA, and N-benzoyl-Val-Gly-Arg-ρNA was examined. These substrates were utilized previously to identify and differentiate PepO and PepE in a genomic library of L. helveticus constructed in E. coli DH5α (8, 13). Derivatives of E. coli DH5α expressing PepO hydrolyzed N-benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-ρNA and N-benzoyl-Val-Gly-Arg-ρNA, while derivatives of E. coli DH5α expressing PepE hydrolyzed N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-ρNA and N-benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-ρNA. Hydrolysis of these substrates by PepO2, with or without PepN, was not observed (data not shown). Additionally, hydrolysis of acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA by CFEs of E. coli DH5α expressing L. helveticus PepO or PepE in coupled assays with PepN was not observed. These results indicated that PepO2 substrate specificity is distinct from PepO and PepE substrate specificity. CFEs from E. coli DH5α expressing L. helveticus PepC or PepX were also examined in a coupled reaction with PepO2 (in place of PepN); the results indicated that only the combined activity of PepN and PepO2 was capable of releasing ρNA from acetyl-β-CN(f 203-209)-ρNA. To examine hydrolysis of the model CN-derived bitter peptides β-CN(f193-209) and αs1-CN(f1-9) by PepO2, RP-HPLC was performed to separate and collect peptide hydrolysis products. No significant hydrolysis of either substrate was detected with CFEs from E. coli DH5α(pJDC9). However, significant hydrolysis of both β-CN(f193-209) and αs1-CN(f1-9) was detected with CFEs from E. coli DH5α(pSUW99) (Fig. 2). The predominant peptide fractions were collected and analyzed. PepO2 was found to hydrolyze β-CN(f193-209) at the Pro-196-Val-197, Pro-200-Val-201, and Pro-206-Ile-207 bonds. Hydrolysis of αs1-CN(f1-9) was observed at the Pro-5-Ile-6 bond (Fig. 3). Top Abstract Introduction MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES DISCUSSION Bitterness in cheese is believed to be the result of accumulation of low-molecular-weight hydrophobic peptides, such as αs1-CN(f1-9) and β-CN(f193-209) (4, 5, 20). In another study, hydrolysis of αs1-CN(f1-9) and β-CN(f193-209) by the L. helveticus CNRZ32 wild-type strain and several peptidase-deficient mutants was investigated (10). The results of that study indicated that L. helveticus contains a previously undetected endopeptidase capable of hydrolyzing β-CN(f193-209) under conditions simulating the conditions in ripening cheese. In this study, the endopeptidase was identified by screening a genomic library of L. helveticus for the ability to hydrolyze the chromogenic substrate N-acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA. The gene identified was determined to code for a protein with the highest level of identity (55%) to PepO from L. helveticus CNRZ32, a previously described metal-dependent endopeptidase (8). Additionally, this endopeptidase exhibits 42% identity to PepO from L. lactis (22, 32), 41% identity to PepO2 from L. lactis, and 36% identity to PepO from L. rhamnosus (11). Unlike the lactococcal PepO proteins, the L. helveticus PepO proteins include cysteine residues and are translated from a monocistronic message. The presence of duplicated PepO proteins in both lactococci and lactobacilli suggests that these enzymes may have important physiological functions. However, inactivation of L. helveticus PepO did not result in any observable change in the ability to grow in milk or amino acid-containing defined media (8). Several attempts to construct a PepO2 deletion mutant derivative of L. helveticus CNRZ32 via two-step gene replacement were unsuccessful (data not shown), suggesting that this enzyme is required for viability. Additional research is required to establish the physiological roles of L. helveticus PepO and PepO2. The substrate specificity of PepO2 was assessed with chromogenic peptide substrates and two CN-derived peptides. The inability of PepO2 to hydrolyze the chromogenic substrates used to identify PepO and PepE from L. helveticus suggested that PepO2 has distinct substrate specificity. This suggestion was supported by the ability of PepO2 to hydrolyze acetyl-β-CN(f203-209)-ρNA in conjunction with PepN, while no hydrolysis by either PepE or PepO was observed under the same conditions. The bonds hydrolyzed in αs1-CN(f1-9) and β-CN(f193-209) by PepO2 were either Pro-Val or Pro-Ile bonds, indicating that PepO2 is a post-proline endopeptidase. Hydrolysis of the β-CN(f193-209) Pro-204-Phe-205 and αs1-CN(f1-9) Pro-2-Lys-3 bonds was not observed, suggesting that PepO2 may have a preference for small uncharged amino acids on the carboxy side of the scissile bond. The hydrolysis of peptide bonds involving Pro is likely to be important in the hydrolysis of CN-derived peptides as Pro constitutes 16.7% of β-CN and 8.5% of αs1-CN amino acid residues (29). Additionally, CN-derived bitter peptides have been observed to contain relatively large amounts of Pro, and it has been proposed that the spatial structure resulting from the presence of Pro in a peptide is directly related to bitterness (20). Therefore, the specificity of PepO2 for bonds containing Pro suggests that this enzyme may have a central role in the demonstrated ability of L. helveticus CNRZ32 to reduce bitterness in cheese. In future studies we will examine if strains overexpressing PepO2 can reduce bitterness and increase flavor development in bacterial ripened cheeses (i.e., Cheddar and Gouda). Additionally, the possible interaction between PepO2 and other components of the L. helveticus CNRZ32 proteolytic system, such as PepN, will be assessed by using combinations of strains overexpressing peptidases.
